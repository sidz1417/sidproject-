can be used as either a handheld unit or a permanent install
great value as it comes with a battery back for regular aa a rechargeable battery pack for rechargeable aas and the vehicle mounted cable for power and signali bought this cb radio for my jeep
i use it when i am wheeling with my jeepin buddies and it works very well
i like how i can plug it into my jeep cig lighter or snap on the mobile battery pack and take it on the goi really dont care for cbs but i do drive a lot and this one has saved me a lot of time and money
hard to believe that you can get everything you need built in to the mic without having to mount a permanent unit under your dash
easily moved from car to car without tools and trouble i highly recommend this to anyone needing a cbok  my first cb i love this thing so far so good
good quality and looks durable
i did go buy an external antenna to boost reception 
ill be testing this more this weekend when i go offroading with a buddy and his cb
i recommend thiskiller compact cb for motorcycle or any vehicle
even if you rarely have need for emergency roadside communication this radio has options that exceed many full size cb radios
mujltiple freq scanning and programmable favorites
instant access to the channels you follow
compact portable and simple to usei read a couple reviews that urged me to buy only a new midland  but being thrifty i decided to buy an amazon return productmistake
fail
i know you can save money buying refurb but in this case my refurbed radio was missing the key part the mobile assembly adapter ie
car powerantenna adapter
so while i could use it at home it was worthless in the cari will update my review after i receive the new one i just ordered
my suggestion if you buy this and the product is well regardedbuy newand only newif you ignore this warning be sure you check for all the parts and return if you dont get them
i read about so many people that say well it was missing so and so but i just kept it anyway
nojust my  centsbuy new
update july  i did return the original used radio and bought new
this is a really nice product and i have revised my review to  starsi got this for backup communications in the event cell towers go down natural or manmade disasters and i fully believe it will serve wonderfully in that capacity
just be sure to practice a bit with it and become proficient before you really need itinstalled this in my x fits entirely in the center console when im not using it
with a  firestik antenna ive had conversations with base stations  miles away
overall love it for being compact and versatilewow great unit like the battery saver memory keys scans channels for activity
battery life is super like other reviews have said
have to have a cobra adapter to use the magnetic roof mount
the unit does just as well with roof mount as my old unit that has the tradition attached mike and i can take it out easy when parked
i dont talk much just listenthe unit is hard to bring up and face to talk because of all the wires attachedworked as expected
easy to setup using and following instructions
use it every day
its a little long but works fineworks real nice no trouble with the set screw to hold the antenna in place also has instructions on setting itthe antenna was sturdily made and was a better quality than the one i was replacing
the connection points were well thought out to allow ease of installationthe biggest thing about this telescope is its size not how big it is but how small it is
small means easy to carry and that means youll be more motivated to take it out and look at things
more importantly you will take it to good dark sky locations
even with the meade deluxe tripod this scope is easily carried with one hand that and a simple set up make it fun to use
the super plossil zoom eyepiece is a great accessory and the astrostar lets even clutzs like me find cool things to look ati am truly an amateur astronomer
my childhood was peppered with dimestore telescopes that showed me a new blurry world
when i got the extec i expected little more than a brighter blur
to my surprise and  delight i was wrong
out of the box in bad lighting conditions  surrounded by trees i saw some of the most breathtaking images of the  moon
in fact i spent the next six hours observing the moon
i saw  craters in detail
i even saw some craters within craters
i did venture  to a bright star i saw in the sky
it turned out to be jupiter
it was a  highly recognizable jupiter
not another dot in the sky
i could see  three of jupiters moons in orbit
i couldnt even make out jupiters  moons with the naked eyei tried the telescope during the day for  terrestrial viewing
once again i was pleasantly surprised
the local  river area came alive with wildlife
the photographic possibilities are  endlessi purchased the  deluxe field tripod   degree  erecting prism  autostar controller and the  hard case with the  telescope
i highly recommend you do the same
they all add to the total  experience
the tripod is a must for both astrological and terrestrial  viewing
the  degree erecting prism is needed for terrestrial viewing
if you dont use it your images will be inverted
the autostar once  aligned will position the telescope to any viewable object and then  continue to track it
the case is a convenience and insurance policythis controller really became valuable to me after the first  or  viewing sessions with my new etxec
after the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off the controller  assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at
it took some  work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller
i had to  learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope
once i learned the reference stars the unit becomes essential for me to  really enjoy this hobby
i cannot imagine using my telescope without this  controllerthere are two schools of thought on the use of goto telescopes
one school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy
however im a believer in the other viewpoint
i think goto capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone
i purchased the autostar for my etx about a year ago and it has had extensive use
out of the many many times i have used the autostar with the scope i estimate it has performed as desired on  of my viewing nights
unusually i seem to be able to align my etx rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty
i think i have had luck on my side as the etx while a beautiful scope can be a little temperamental
even after doing a quick and rough alignment like pointing it in the general direction of due north without using a compass i still get very accurate results with the autostar
i even changed locations the other day moving from auckland to taupo some  hrs travel distance by car and inadvertantly used the auckland coordinates while viewing in taupo
suprisingly after alignment i still got accurate positioning from the autostar
once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around
the amount of data is staggering but given the size of the playground its not suprising
the unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark
i havnt found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc
the trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score
i suggest that if you are operating from a tripod you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it
otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way
on a couple of occassions i have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself
these have been far and few between and readily fixed itself
ultimately the autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected
one minor problem i am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls
this has occured since i started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating
this however is only a minor niggle
if you have any concerns about your autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar mike weasners site
the autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your etx
clear skies everyone and happy alignmentswe just purchased the meade  etx telescope and decided to get the computer controller too  and man are we glad that we did
were novices with the telescope so finding specific objects in the night sky is a challengewith the autostart after taking about  minutes to go through the alignment process we can just tell the autostar what we want to find and it moves the telescope to the object for us
without this the only thing we would probably look at in the sky is the moonnote if youre not planning to use your telescope to look at objects in the night sky ie
planets etc then you dont need the autostarthese are amazing little locks
i bought  of these to help deter people from taking my computers
these will not prevent someone that is motivated to steal it but it will help to prevent someone from just picking it up and walking away with it when you are not lookingall the stores around here were selling pathetic combo locks i had to return
this works greatas a selfemployed graphic artist i bring my laptop with me even on vacations for the sake of work emergencies
its a  macbook pro so its not small enough for a hotel safe and i hate leaving it out when i leave the room because i just dont want to tempt housekeeping in that way
packing it back up to keep it hidden every time i go out has gotten too tiresome though so i finally looked around and purchased this security cableim so glad i didthis was a fine fit for my laptop model the slot for it is on the right
i wrapped the other end around a closed chair leg so that if anyone decided to take the laptop theyd have to take the chair with them too and call attention to themselves
im aware that anyone really determined to take it still could but my laptop being a fairly old model and the security cable being in place its really not worth it to the casual snatcher and thats enough for my peace of mind it allows me to leave the laptop out on the table ready for me to log in and get right back to work without having to unpack again and boot upworks great  use on an imac computer used for guests in a hotel lobby so far so good and it doesnt stick out like a sore thumbthis notebook lock and security cable is just that it works well and has never failed
the one thing to remember is not to lose any of the two keys providedi purchased this security device for my old trusty ibook
while the laptop is worth like  it does contain information and programs that are priceless to me
i am moving overseas and this cable is exactly what i was looking forthe tbar fits perfectly into apples port and is very easy to take off
i know that some other reviewers were having problems with their newer macbooks so i was a bit concerned
if you have a vintage ibookpowerbookg this should serve you wellremember that this is not a heavy duty chain
if someone has access to your locked laptop for more than  minutes i can think of a handful of ways to break the cable
on hindsight if you leave this attached to a desk while you use the bathroom i would highly doubt that someone could break this within several minutes
although anything is possible  it is still better than nothingyoull always have your power cable with your notebook
what about another cable that helps with securityleave your laptop alone
its going to be safe
i use it on my office college and even home so nobody is going to move it from its placeif still paranoic try the kensington soniclock motion detecting alarm
just like the alarm in your car
both great security toolsas one reviewer pointed out succinctly this is a deterrent
get up and leave your  laptop for a few minutes this lock makes a good deterrent from the casual opportunitydriven thief
no it wont prevent someone vandalizing your laptop
no it wont stop a thief with a good cable cutter
so if you see anyone at the cafe or library with a cable cutter think twice
oh you would anyway
i thought so
some reviewers here must think you have no common sense
so lets assume you do
youre considering this one because its a very affordable deterrent
another kensington with an alarm may appeal to you if you want wander a few feet out of sight of your laptop and want an audible alarm if someone tries to yank it off  but then who in their right mind will try to defeat a laptop with an alarm in a library
its all a matter of risk assessment
if you think you may be leaving your laptop in a place where passersby possess industrialgrade cable cutters or the knowledge to defeat alarms then perhaps you dont want to leave our laptop at allso this affordable little cable is a suitable deterrent where you feel its appropriate for the risk
a relatively benign public location  your place of work where your laptop isnt accessible to anyone but employees and staff   a hotel where only the staff have access to your room
these are places where the risk of theft is minimized and this easytouse cable lock is probably quite appropriatethis is an excellent security cable
long enough to allow one to secure your laptop to something large or fixed to the room construction
i bought this one to replace one that i had a few years ago my wife abducted iton my macbook pro the keyhole for the cable is on the right hand side
the lock works smoothly and reliablydr zlocks up nicely to any stationary object
keeps laptop secure from random hands picking it up and taking it
long enough to secure it and still have freedom to move it around the deskproduct seems well made although you cant stop anyone who is determined to bring the necessary tools to cut the cable
hopefully it will slow someone down or at least keep an honest person honestafter reading some of the reviews having to do with macbooks and this item warping the plastic i was skeptical
since the combination lock versions seem to be incredibly unreliable i decided to give this one a try it being a reasonably priced lock
i havent had any problems with it so far using it everyday for about  weeks while at work
it is very easy to use
the only thing you have to make sure is that the main flat part that goes into the slot lines up with the prongs that are on either side
its sort of hard to explain but once you have it in your hand you will see what i mean
once the prongs and flat part are aligned the lock fits easily into the security slot
just give it one good quarter of a turn and your macpc is safe
i experienced no warping of my macbook casing in fact there is a little rubber part that separates the metal lock that the key goes in from your mac preventing any sort of scratching
overall a good lock at a reasonable pricei am very happy with my cable lock
although it does not make your computer equal to fort knox it will at the very least slow a wouldbe theif down
i can hang my lb laptop off of it and bounce it up and down  with the cable and it holds firm trial conducted over my bed a heavily  padded surface
i like how the cable swivels around the actual lock to  avoid the cable kinking and becoming cumbersome
i also like the fact that  it is a key operated system
although combinations are quicker they can be  hacked in about  minutes of trying and slipping a key in the lock and  giving a quick turn cant be any simpler
just remember to keep one key in  a safe place and write the key serial number down somewhere so a  replacement can be found
for the money i dont think there is a better  security option for notebook computers unless you spend the  on a  doberman puppy and train it to attack computer theifs
but that would be  hard
buy this lock system and it could save you when it comes to notebook physical security you need a device that will deter crimes of opportunity  such as those presented by leaving your notebook at your desk at work or at a table in a library while you browse the shelves
if you want to protect your notebook from a determined thief buy a safemost cable security devices are going to provide about the same amount of security so you need to focus on ease of use
if a device is easy to use then youre more likely to use it and use it properly
the kensington system doesnt get much simpler
it consists of a cable which is wrapped around a reasonably unmoveable object and an attached key lock that attaches directly to your notebooks security slotcompare the kensington system with the curtis  system and youll probably agree that the kensington system is far easier to use
compare its  piece system to the curtis system which uses a cable a seperate metal piece that hooks to the notebooks security slot and a seperate lock that connects that piece to the cable
thats  seperate pieces a little more effort to hook everything up and the possibility of losing that tiny metal piece the whole system depends onive used both the kensington and the curtis systems at work and have found the kensington system to be far easier to use
i put one key on my keyring put the other key someplace safe and can toss the cable into my bag and be good to go
with the curtis system i had to make use of its storage bag just so i wouldnt lose the individual pieces
im also sure the extra effort required to setup the curtis system will prevent some people from using the device as much as they shouldthe kensington system costs a little more money but it is definitely worth it
its my choice for my personal notebookkensington is the best price is good the lock is easy and works smoothly
another great product from kensingtonjust received this lock
first impressions are good the cable is thicker than what you usually see on this type of product
the key is big and easy to locate
the ruber insert keeps your laptop from getting scratched not really a concern on this laptopi can confirm that the fit is loose but this does not affect how it secures to the device
there is some wiggle room but not enough that it would be able to be shimmied off
things that i am thinking of now are specific to my laptop
the kensington slot is right by my system fan which i have a laptop that blows out  degree air
the metal lock gets very hot
perhaps being so hot will further deter would be thievesits no secret that cable can be cut the hope is that no one with tools will come across your laptop and have enough time to snatch iti have three of these and im pleased with them
i leave two laptops secured to the desk at all times and the third sits in my laptop backpack ready for travel
these are light and simple to operate
no complaints
ive used the kensington brand laptop cables for years  i think since they first came out
i lose them periodically but keep buying more
i highly recommendas a bonus it looks like the newer external hard drives are now being made with the laptop security holenotch so you can secure these with the security cables also
very nice
my new seagate gb freeagent does for sure but ive seen the security features mentioned in reviews of other drives as welli recently bought an lg ln smart tv and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a kensington lock portthis is rather useful since in my country and my neighourhood it provides me with the peace of mind i need if i go to work or on trips to know that my tv is held securely to my wallthe cable itself is made of good quality and if my  inch tv was left to be suspended by the cable im sure it would easily handle the weightif you have a smart tv with a kensington lock port and you want an extra level of security i recommend this lockmy daughter used this at school for her computer and it works so well best money ive spent on collegei make sure to lock my laptop up whenever i may be away from it for a long period of time
this lock is very sturdy and quick to enabledisable
its portable so i can take it with me on vacation to secure my laptop where ever i ammy sister bought this lock for me as i will be going off to college soon
i have a  aluminum  macbook pro  this lock works well with it
it took a while to get it to work but after reading reviews i found out that you have to align the little t on the lock with the  poles by inserting the key  then turning it rightwards
once you have done that you can just insert it into your laptop  give the key a slight turn
the cable also seems like it would be pretty sturdy to discourage the average thiefvery easy to use on my dell inpsiron laptop
locks securely to the docking station or to the laptop
no complaintsused for laptop at senior center so noone could leave with it
it was easy to install on laptop and put thru cable hole on desk for security of the laptopi admit i dont take this everywhere i only have it for when i really need it but in those cases it works like it should
i use it for my macbook pro   and im pretty happy with iti really love this kensington lock
it just snaps right in
no little plug for the whole is necessary
the part that locks into the whole is built onto the end of the cable
it took me a few minutes to figure out that i had to use the key to attach the lock to the lap top but once i figured out how to use it it is a very quick lock or unlock
i could have read the directions but wheres the fun in thati do a lot of working travel and im always wary when i have to leave my laptop in the hotel room
a friend of mine had his stolen from the hotel room and the hotel took no responsibility for the loss
from that moment i decide that i needed a product with excellent reputation so after a good research over the internet i chose the kensington f microsaver notebook lock and security cable
of course a thief is a thief but if someone attempts to steal my laptop for sure they are going to have to carry the big desk from the hotel room togetherit does just what it says itll do if your pc has a locking slot almost all do now and the place where youre working has a secure piece of hardware to secure it the airplanegrade cable schools libraries airports et
al
 all wouldbe casual thieves will move on
as for more determined thieves thats perhaps another story
back up your dataso it took me a few minutes to figure out how to line up the little pins and the head thingy
once i had that under control this works just fine
inserts and removes easily and the cord doesnt get in the way
just goes about its business and does what it is supposed to doshipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product
the lock and cable appear to be of good quality
the keys work flawlessly and i prefer over the combination lock models
it was listed and purchased as a used item but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones
how much abuse can a lock like this take
i have always had good success with purchasing used items through amazon
if there is ever a problem it is accepted back immediatelydurable comes to mind when receiving this product
easy to install and uninstall
for the price a most have and a great buyworks as advertised
the lock can seem a bit finicky until you learn how to lock it right
it works greati have been using one of these for a few years and just bought another one for my brother
its more of a theft deterrent than a theft prevention product
if somebody really wanted to cut the cable or rip the lock out im sure they could
but it would be easier just steal the laptop right next to it with no lock
thats the reason i use itit was easy to connect this to the laptop
no code to share or remember
if you know where the keys are you also know who has accessappears to be sturdy and function as intended
no issues
it will work with a targus pap defcon security baseplate but threading the needle is a bit tightmy product came packaged neatly in a clear plastic bag
comes with two keys with bright orange tags
and a paper manual with the code to replace your keys if you ever lose them
never got the link to the site to work so codes were practically uselessthe cable has two different ends
one end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loopthe end with the lock can swivel so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangledi wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop
this way unless someone has a cable cutter or enough strength to rip the leg off the desk they should not be able to steal the physical laptop
unless they were aiming for the hard drive graphics card or ddr ram that would be a different storycable is almost no different than the heavy duty bicycle security cables
it has a diameter of roughly   cm
so a decent cable cutter can cut the cable in halfthis is only a simple way to ward off thieves in a very basic environment
better than nothingfinal thoughts i only got this since i needed to use my laptop on my desk at my parttime job and i cant be bothered constantly locking my laptop in the cabinet every time i step away from the deskkeeps thieves from stealing your entire laptop
if they were aiming at the components of your laptop all they need is a phillips screwdriver and plastic gloves
or if they had a good compact cable cutter which nowadays are quite smallfor  not a bad deal
to me was better than a retractable cable as those are weaker and thinner
the long cable is good if i ever needed the extra lengthfits in my asus  inch nsveh laptop and my acer  inch vp laptopmay recommend to others i dont know how long it would keep thieves off my laptop but something is better than nothing
dthis product does a great job of theft deterrent
i say theft deterrent because a determined thief with a pair of strong wire cutters could probably get through it
however this is the case with any cablelocknon the less the cable itself is thick and high quality
the thicker design makes it both look and feel sturdier as well as more deterring to a thief than some other thinner cables ive seen
its black plastic coating helps to make it more aesthetically pleasing and keep the metal from rubbing against my wooden desk
like many other cables this one uses a loop design as the anchorwhile the thicker design is great for strength it lacks flexibility the only downfall of the entire product
while this cable is capable of making sharp turns it takes a lot of effort
if you have a sharp bend near the lock it could put a lot of torque on your computerthe actual lock is free to rotate to keep the cable from twisting
the lock uses a barrel key and comes with two copies allowing me to keep one on my key chain and a spare in my safe additional keys can be order through kensington using the id number on the side of the keys should you need them
when deciding between cables i decided on one with a key because i travel around a lot and wanted to be able to quickly lock and unlock my computeroverall this is a great product
i currently only need one but should the need arise i would certainly a secondpros thick cable long cable aesthetically pleasing two keyscons not very flexiblequite seriously i dont have to wear the carpal tunnel cuff now
i dont have to keep looking for room to move the mouse on my little typing area
i set the controls to fast and it just barely takes a tiny bit of fingertip action to get all the way across my screen
when i click both left and right buttons at the same time i can leap tall buildings at a single bound  and have barbecued kryptonite for lunchyes this really is a seriously good computer tool and i strongly recommend you get one to save your wristsi went to the store and tried a lot of these this is the most comfortable one to me
plug  play
easy to use
ps or usbi purchased the lower end version of this product the tv wonder ve
it has met all my needs in a tv tuner card to go in the pci slot of my lowend emachinemy emachine did come with a ati video card so i think that  made it really easy
it also accepts composite input something i havent  tried yethad a minor audio issue with this product
called support got  a stupid person once helpful person the next time i calledoverall good  product i assume the regular more expensive product is even betterwhat wonderful speakers these are
i read the reviews here on amazon and decided to use my gift certificates courtesy of echocom towards these speakers
i admit when i pulled them out of the box they looked awfully weenie
after pluggin them in and firing up good old winamp their quality blew me away
the human voice sounds so convincing through the  inch satellite speakers and the subwoofer compliments them perfectly
unlike other systems ive heard the sub quotknowsquot when not to broadcast the resulting response is amazingmy only qualms about ordering this system is that its packing weight  lbs carries a corresponding shipping cost of a little over  bucks
well worth it but something to consider when figuring the final cost
 id recommend this system to anybody
check it outi used this speaker set for more than half a year now and it served me great
the sound quality is good dont expect hifi quality sound of course
the subwoofer is sounds great too
at the back it can accept  line input so i can connect my  pc to the same box wo problem
generally it is a very good computer speakeri use it to convert old tapes to cd via computer as well as playing cds and cassettes on it
having the two media in one unit is a real space saver and convenient too
the mechanicals and sound performance are excellent
headphones port with its own vol
contol a nice feature
thanks teacwere dinosaurs that still have come cassette tapes we like to listen to and good luck finding a cheapo deck to use with a higher end stereo system  this little gem combines a single cd with cassette
i like the auto repeat function
the size and price and combo unit had great appeal
never used the remote so dont know
easy to install and use right away  no complex hookup needed
i dont have any complaints about the sound quality or functionality of this uniti bought this to transfer old cassettes to disc
it has been a wonder to work with
i have found nothing that doesnt work beyond expectations
with the autoreverse i just start it up and copy the whole tape to pc in no time at all
playback on the cassette deck is greatbought this unit based on reviews listed herehave not been disappointed
nice unit easy to use and of seemingly good quality
happy customercd changers are getting very hard to find at a good price
i really like this jvc changer
it replaces a three or four year old fairly high end sony changer that started skipping the first  seconds of every disc
the changer is connected to a yamaha rxv receiver via a fiber optic connector the same path as the sony changer
i was very surprised at how much better cds sound on this player
im totaly sold
my guess you can spend a lot more money and not be any happierone downside to this changer it is tall
but ill take tall with good sounding solid mechanicals to short and cheap soundingafter having read all the glowing reviews i purchased this item and was not disappointed
this is a very nice full quality function cd player
i have been very pleased with this item and its performancemany people will tell you that you cant tell one cd player or cd changer from another as far as sound
well it seems as though i can and this jvc machine has the best specs in its price range
i listen to everything from rock to classical and the reproduction of this machine is second to none
there are more advanced cd changers that cost two or even three times as much and yet they dont come close to the sound of this cd changeri guess i am bad talking about the features of this machine
so i will leave that up to somebody else
i will say that you can load three cds at one time which is more than most cd changers
i just like it for the meat and potatoes of the basics of sound reproductionedit  right now i am a man with two stereos
i know that i should be so lucky
this jvc is with my old a system
i have owned this model or the  just below it a few times before
my last jvc  lasted only  months before starting to skip uncontrollably
i have had durability problems with this model even though as ive said it has the best specs in its class
when not owning the jvc ive owned a harmon kardon which sounded superior but costed more and broke after only  months
ive also owned sonys both the budget mid and highend models and have various problems from not being satified with the sound to not being able to play copies or mps
currently my b system has a yamaha  which has great specs but is more expensive
i hope the yamaha will be more durablethis is my second jvc cd changer i gave the first one i purchased five years ago to my mother and its still working like a champ
this player has  excellent sound and the controls on the front panel and on the remote are  well laid out
the disk exchange feature is nice you can leave one disk  playing while you swap the others
the only  downside to this player is on  the programming you cannot add tracks to a program once it is entered  doing so stops the program and you have to start over again
this is mostly  annoying when you are recording to md or tape and realize that you have  forgotten a songi dont understand all the negative reviews about this changer
ive owned this changer for about  months now and find it more than suitable for casual use
my previous  disc changer was a kenwood cd purchased in  i also own a pioneer  disc changer
before purchasing this changer i was quite apprehensive due to the negative reviews on here
i bit the bullet as my kenwood changer was acting up and i am quite happy with this productthis changer has never skipped on me or presented other issues
i use the optical output on the changer to connect to my receiver and the quality is excellent
the remote works even with sloppy angles
the changer is quiet when changing cds rotating the carousel and the display is readable from across the roomthere are a few little quirks  the changer differentiates between exchanging a cd thus not interrupting the currently playing cd and not opening the drawer all the way and open which stops the current cd and opens the drawer
personally i find the distinction a little annoying since i almost always want to exchange
my previous kenwood has no such distinctioni also wish the remote layout and buttons were a little more friendly to use by touch and not by sighti like to listen to music in low light or even darkness so i had to memorize some of the remote buttons in particular disc skip is located in the middle of the remotehowever these are extremely minor nits
the changer is excellent feels sturdy and has survived about  hours of use in the last  months
i am delighted with my purchase and would recommend the changer to anyone looking for a low capacity changeri am pleased with this cd player after searching thru best buy and circuit city it was a welcome relief to find a product i really wantedsound quality is excellent for the price and it is very easy to use i highly recommend this playeri love this changer it does everything i want it to do
it can do random playing as well as straight forward and continuous play which means i can listen to a variety of music for hoursmy fiancee and i have many many vhs and dvd movies
here vhs player started messing up so we went to store after store looking for a cleaning tape
finally ordered two cleaning tapes online
both work greati have a temperamental dvd player
i ordered this dry head cleaner because it is so temperamental about what we use in itjust as advertised
arrived quickly
seems to have fixed the tracking problem on a veryold vcr with many hours useput this tape and just push play and it cleans your vcr
my tvvcr combo is an old model that i found free on the road side  which had a fuzzy playback mode and and the voice was almost nonexistent
after playing the tape twice i now have a crystal clear picture and a normal voice on the  vcr playbackmost of us have old vhs tapes in the closet and the vp keeps your vcr delievering a clean imagewhat more can i sayit worksi have always used wet system vhs head cleaner cassettes since i can remember but i have found the maxell vp vhs dry tape video head cleaner to work just fine
generally if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems
in fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads
most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play prerecorded budget tapes in your vcr
you may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads linear audio heads rollers and guides
in these instances wet system vhs head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me but i have found that this maxell dry head cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely
this maxell vp vhs dry tape video head cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your owni have found that for best performance it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your vhs playerrecorder
this allows you to stop build oxide up before it becomes a major problem
i have not had to use a wet cleaner in over  years nowi use my vcr for high quality audio recordings
this cleaner does a great job of cleaning up the slight noise i get when tape heads start to get dirty
highly recommendedthis is an absolutely amazing product
twice it has made a vcr that is at least  years old go from unusable to working like a charm
it has certainly kept us from throwing out our vcr
i definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to get more life out of their vcrit works clean and prefect
what else can be said but get itthis item arrived on time and in good condition
i have several vhs players and this is a must for me
very easy to use to get great results without having to open up the vhs unit to clean it though i still do once in a while just to visually check the bands
this works as good as the wet type head cleaner but without the hassle of adding drops into the head cleaner tape
i recommend this head cleaner
i give this a  star rating because this is the simpliest way to clean the video and audio heads of a vhsthis is quickly becoming a very hard to get item since vcrs are now few and far betweenthis item is almost nonexistent in storesit does the job it was made foryou cant ask for anything morethis is an excillent head cleaner
there are visual graphics on the tape that talk you through the process  you get a little chart that you can stick on the tape case which shows that you can get  uses out of it
then just toss it out  replace it
this cleaner really improves the av quality on a vcri have an old vcr that was getting quite dirty and this did the trick at cleaning the heads
they are getting harder and harder to find but im glad i finally found this one to purchaseman oh mani stuck this sucker in  really less than  secs later it was doneso i thought nah nothing is ever going to clean my dirty heads of my old vhs player tv combobut how wrong i wasas i did it again just to be sureand less than  secs laterdone 
so either dry vhs cleaners are better than the wet type or i and i alone got a magic special cleaner for my tvvhs comboeasy to use
i would recommend this product over other products
it was cheaper online than it was at the storenever thought id be needing one of these again
in fact what is a vcranyway my disney movies were crackly and the screen was fuzzy
ran this puppy through and they were like new againi dont know why these outdoor speakers were so cheap they replaced much larger speakers that eventually gave it up to the weather conditions but the sound is even better
they are powered with a standard watt sonos receiveramplifier unit and still sound teriffic
in fact i like them so much that ill probably take them down for the winter to avoid having to replace them in a few yearsi bought these to mount under my deck for some outdoor tunes and they work great
sure they dont have the deep bass that you might expect from expensive indoor speakers but at this price they do they job perfectly
they have already been through several rain storms here in georgia and continue to work fine
highly recommendedthese speakers are great
the have high quality sound and worked great for my computers external speakers
i love the quality when listening to my cdsbought  pair for an outdoor screened porch for  per pair
they sound great were easy to mount and oh so inexpensive
weve had some gatherings and the sound has been plenty and when sitting out quiet it sounds great toofor the porch setup i also purchased a stereo receiver sherwood for 
my main goal was to allow radio play and to use an ipod as source for the screened porch
well the sound is great nice lows and can even blast all the neighbors the components were cheap except the ipod and i can feel okay leaving the receiver outdoors out of direct rain path but definitely gets plenty of dust and humiditywe were moving and didnt want to leave the bose  speakers that i had installed in every room of our home
i looked for speakers that were less expensive to leave in their place and took a chance on these audio source ls  speakers based upon the reviews here in amazoncom
although the reviews were good one doesnt expect real quality at this price
you cannot imagine our surprise at the quality of the sound these speakers reproduced
they are not as spacial as the bose but their dynamic and acoustic range is excellent
like the bose they fall off rapidly below about hz but are very linear up to the audible limits
if you want more bass add a subwooferi mounted them under my eaves and they work great
i thought because they were so cheap that the sound would be cheap but they sound great and have worked fine after a few rain stormsthey do a good job
i put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years
great sound
i would buy them again
great bargain for the priceive owned a pair of these speakers for several years
i have been and continued to be amazed at the sound quality these very cheap speakers provide
they are part of my budget home theater system in my bedroom the other components being a s pioneer receiver a five year old pioneer dvd player and a samsung  crt tv
theater on a budgetseveral years ago i was taking some very nice used bookshelf speakers  back to a hifi store to trade them in on larger speakers
just for fun i wired one of these beautiful little wooden speakers to one channel of the pioneer receiver and one of these audio source speakers to the other channel
then i moved the balance from left to right and back a few times to see what the difference was in the sound
i was amazed to find i could not hear a significant difference in the soundanyway ive enjoyed going to sleep to jazz on fm radio and watching dvds with the sound coming through these speakers for several years now
it makes me wonder if all the hype about expensive speakers and specs in the hi fi world is just a load ofwell you knowsure these are not the worlds greatest speakers
yes the bass is a little low but you are only paying thirty something dollars
for the price the speakers are amazing they have some good volume before they distort and they have better bass than all the leading name brands that run one to two hundred dollars
i put a pair of inifinity outdoors in a side by side comparison and actually had better bass output from the audiosource
so i took the inifinitys back and had enough money to buy a  disc cd changer and money left over to buy an extra pairs of audiosource speakers for the garage and more on the decki would recommond these speakers to anyone who wants good sound quality outside at a cheap price
if you are looking for surround sound speakers then look elsewherei put this pair of speakers outside on the right side of my garage facing my backyardand boy does it produce nice sound
i placed it up under the roofline so it would stay a little drier
i live in rainy houston we have had  or  heavy rainstorms and the speakers are still working just fine
this pair was a great price arrived very quickly and sounds just fine
buy it and save moneybeautifully soft and comfortable coneshaped earphones and the only ones ive ever found that dont keep falling out of my ears like earbuds do
good sound quality and excellent price with the superb koss reputation behind themgreat sound for the price
plus absolutely amazing sound isolation for traveling
for  you get something that paying  wouldnt compete withive traveled with my friend and his high dollar bose noise canceling headphones and while those are more comfortable since the dont sit in the ear the isolation was just as goodmine wore out after a little over a year so i mailed them back to koss since they have a lifetime warranty and i got a new paircant beat thatonly downside is that wearing them for hours and hours can cause your ear canals to be a little soreive compared these ear buds to shure ecs  and creative zen auravanas  and found them better than the shures and almost as good as the auravanas in certain ways and better in other ways the bass on the auravanas is too thumping and cable noise is worse than the koss
theyre just plain astounding  especially for the money
if you want to buy something that beats all three get the creative eps
incredible sound that just barely beats these little koss buds  but theyre 
for the money the koss cant be beat periodi tried the sure ecs as an attempt to upgrade from my normal sennheiser mxs
the sures are sturdy very inconvenient to use and i couldnt get them to seal properly in my ears no matter how much fidgeting i did
so i bought the plug another mx and still saved at least  bucks over the sure productthe plug sounds terrific for the money
the sound isolation was good and they were easy to fit to your ear properly and produced a good all around sound revealing sounds absent when i use my sennheisers
the bass is more prominent but didnt seem out of balanceit was just easier to hear and a little muddy ltwhat can you expect for  bucks
i listen to a lot of rockin blues and these are perfect because you can hear the typical basslines in a standard blues band group betteris the plug better than the sure which is far more expensive
for me it is but only because i could get the plug to seat properly in my ears and couldnt with the sure
i think the sure ecs would sound awesome if they would fit properly albeit lots more inconvenient to usei kid you not
decided to splurge over  on a super set of earphones for my ipod from shure and hated them and sent them back
then i tried these as a temporary solution and found them actually vastly superior in sound aesthetics and discrete form
i simply love them
as a frequent traveller i appreciate not hearing the usual yada yada on the airplane
highly recommend themgot my first pair around  years ago loved them then and still love them now
they fit and seal well block as much ambient noise as safety ear plugs and they sound awesome to me
i use them with a sansa clip zip at work  hours a day  days a week and they are comfortable
they require less volume to be used than some competitors brandssaving battery life to reach a desired level and will certainly go loud enough to make you deaf if you push them
using the sansas equalizer allows me to adjust the levels to fit my music and tastes to a sweet sound
i listen to mostly hard rock classic rock country and some blues and i find that while maybe they arent audiophile quality they are really good for the priceok the first thing about this review
i have a pair of the new the plug headphones
they are not the ones pictured here
they have no mute button and are metallic silver and purple in color not blue and yellowapprently koss got a lot of feedback from the first version they listened and made a much better product
the ones i have are just fantastic
great bass like the original but very good mids and lows as well
they work better as isolation headphones then anything i have used before but apprently people who are audiophiles are not that impressed
also they have fantastic volume ability
because they are in your ear canal i can turn my portable equipment up really loud
i dont but its nice if you want to
music sounds great with these headphones
frankly best headphones i have ever used but i am using the new version not the blue and yellow ones pictured hereok right now what to do
i would call amazon and make sure you are getting the new version
i never used the one they have listed here but almost everywhere i looked on the net people say the new version is much bettervery comfortable
great tone and bass sounds
sound isolations is great
they are very affordable and i definitely recommend these for anyone who is looking for a great buythis time i bought a new pair because my cat decided to play with the old pair
these are not cat toys but how do you convey that to a cat that doesnt listen anyway
the pair i bought before these was for a family member who still loves them and has given a pair as a gift to a few friendswhen inserted correctly these are better than the  bose noise cancelling headphone and much cheaper
the sound quality is outstanding and the cable is durable except when a cat plays with it
i do suggest you purchase the ear bud replacements as well since these can get a bit funky after being used for a while
also make sure you purchase the correct ear buds
i learned the hard way that koss makes different buds for their headphonesat this price point youre not going to find a better pair of reasonably durable earbuds with this quality of sound or noisecanceling ability
id say that ive gone through a pair every few years and ill continue to buy these as needed
they block some sound the sound quality is fine and you wont be devastated when you realize that youve forgotten them on the plane and need to buy a new pairi have two challenges which have made finding proper fitting ear buds problematic
first my ear canals are a bit on the small side
this issue does not transcend my ear canals but i digress  secondly im missing that little flap of skin that other people have on their misshapen ears that holds ear buds in place
despite these challenges these things stay in place are quite comfortable and sound good in the bargainif youre interested there is also a wealth of information on the internets that explains how to modify these things to make them sound and fit even better
for now im plenty happy with what i got for my i like to tune everything else out and just hear my music when i listen to my music
these work perfectly
the fit will be different for different ears i actually turn the foam around to stick the bigger side in first
once they seal i get deep bass clear music and isolation from outside noise so i dont have to listen to them as loud to get that my own world feelingonly drawback they do wear out
ive gone through  sets in about  years first set the foam wore out replaced just the foam then the foam piece would keep falling out
second set same thing
the third set is the only one that actually broke
i use them to work out and one of the cables started to go the one side would turn on and off depending on how you moved the cablefor the price if they only last a year its still worth it
sound quality is great isolation is great and ive returned  sets that promised amazing deep bass that didnt even compare to the base i get with thesethe plugs feel like safety plugs and remove almost as much noisewhen  i put these on i was able to reduce my volume level in halfi am now able to listen to my mp player while mowing the lawnbut the feel took a while to get used to
soft and spongy in my ear didnt feel right at firstgreat value for the priceive been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them
they greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely
i especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportationi purchased these portable headphones based on information in a review by an amazon customer
they are great
i replaced the earphones i received with my zen nano and i am so pleased
these are really superior to what came with my zen nano
they block out most of the outside sound and my cd recordings sound supersince i go to the gym every day i love the fact that these stay put and allow me to do my daily routine
they can pretty much be molded by squeezing the eartips themselves and letting them expand when you put them in your eari would absolutely buy another set of koss plugsupdatejanuary these portable headphones are still going strong and i use them  days a week at the gym
i am so pleased that when the time comes i will definitely purchase koss againif you want to go jogging or work out while listening to music these headphones will stick in your ears like an earplug staying put until you explicitly try to remove them
since they block out sound well and stick close to your eardrum they can produce very powerful and clear sound despite their size
they hide pretty well
their foam piece is cheap online and easy to replace which is important because they will wear out with all the squishing to make them fit in your ears
best of all they are cheapplease keep in mind though that they pretty much function as earplugs
this can be a good thing and a bad thing
if you go jogging and fail to look both ways at roads you may not notice a car approaching
however if you want to be alone with your music and your thoughts such as if you are add then will serve you wellthese headphones work well and if used properly by gently rolling the foam then immediately inserting into ear these will stay put and act similar to an ear plug allowing you to hear your music at a low volume level since they block outside noisethey are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal
this fit is better than silicon earbuds
the sound quality id much better than any earbud in this price rangei was looking for something to replace the headphones that came with my ipod since theyre extremely uncomfortable but i do like the sound quality
ive been through about  different kinds
some ive passed off due to comfort and some due to bad sound quality
these ear buds are like putting the small foamy ear plugs in your ears
ive always found them pretty comfortable and these headphones are the same
the sound quality is very different than the ipod ear buds and full of bass
they also certainly block out a lot of background noise
like i said theyre like putting in the foamy earplugs
i highly recommend these headphones especially like the pricethese headphones are the best idea ive seen in quality sound for several yearsfirst the foam is similar to those inear safety earplugs you simply roll the foam between two finger and insert the headphones into the ear
the foam them reexpands blocking out sounds and noise letting you hear your music books etc
much cleaner
the foam on these inearheadphones is easily replaceable and come with a replacement setkoss has been known for years for their quality sounds equipment and these headphoneearbuds are no exception
the sound quality of these was  better than my bose earbud headphones and the noise blocking was unsurpassed with these koss the plug headphones
they have even replaced my  headphones with their quality and great sound experiencea word of caution however they do block sounds around you so make sure not to wear them if you need to hear anything else around you
then again you might want too especially when those around you are boring and annoyingyou will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back and that you cant get them in your ears fast enoughkoss obviously made great improvements to the foam
the foam is now slow recovery meaning you can get it into your ear
this alleviates the only real downside to the producti gave these  stars because the price of  
they are somewhat heavy on the bass side but thats ok with me since its not overkill and you can always adjust the bass with an eq
i did not read any of the reviews before buying them as they were cheap enough but now im amazed at how good they sound
i wont tell you these are great just letting you know they are a good to try
i also liked the kscs which for a few  more are another great buy and sound better but are clipon over ear styleive owned sennheiser sony and other headphones and these are by far the best of the lot
ive used my pair for five months and they have held up well to the rigors of daily use
factor in the price and you cant go wrongi have many headphones many of the head band variety and some of the conventional earbud variety
this is my first purchase of the in the ear type
i never expected the fit to be as comforatble as i found it to be and did not expect the sound to be as good as it is
i think that koss is aiming for high volume sales at a very low price for such an excellent product
on top of it all they offer a lifetime guarantee
how can you beat this bargainkoss the plug for only  is a terrific way to try the earcanal type of headphone
they are very comfortable to wear for long periods have terrific bass good sound and are comfortable to wear when in bed
ones opinion of headphone sound is very subjective and comparison is limited because you cannot instantly change from one phone to another
one reason that there are endless opinions of headphone soundthe plug has foam inserts that expand too fast making it almost impossible to get it into the ear before it expands
if you do not get a good air seal there will be little or no bassthe fix is to buy a set of  foam ear plugs walmart  for 
squeeze it flat use a scissor for cut proper length resqueeze under water let it expand full size freeze it and then drill the hole to replace the existing foam insert
you will end up with an ear plug that really works and is very comfortable to wear
you probably will be so happy with the plug that you wont have to upgrade to the  modelsthe original foam cusion is not very comfortable
there is an excellent article on which describe a simple mod to make it an excellent sound isolating inear monitor
based on your listening preference you may decrease the bass or mid level damping
the mod will make it a poor mans shurei own  pairs of these now and am totally satisfied with them
i have probably about  sets of ear buds and headphones for a variety of purposes
not any single set serves one purpose but for the purposes i use these for casual listening while sitting or walking and noise isolation these are perfect
theyre the only device ill use to listen to music through my smart phone or laptop
i love the way they seal of the sounds from the outside world as the foam stem covers slowly expand in your earsthe horrible ear buds that came with my pricey mp player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place
i could wear these little koss plugs all day long and never know theyre there
and sound quality is perfecti always liked koss headphones
the price and the sound
some reviews say that it is bass heavy
if you have an eq mode on your mp player then try that to adjust the sound to your liking
ipods and zunes players have good eq settings
love the ear cushions
they fit really good
would recommend these headphones especially for the pricenoteto get the cushions to fit in properly
try this lightly squeeze the foam then insert in to your ear and hold for about  sec
it should form inside the ear and you not have a problem of them slipping outnow these are not balanced to start with more boost in the muddy area hzhz
but with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good
they rival even my sony mdrhds when this cut is applied
i also have an communications headset from koss sb for  which ive used for gaming and mixing audio
koss just makes great sounding gear but pay for the high end stuff to get outofthebox balancedi was looking for headphones that i could be comfortable with for long periods of timei use my mp player for listening to audio books and the headphones that came with it became very uncomfortable after just a short period of time in my ears
i also didnt want to spend a fortuneafter much looking i decided to give these a try and they have worked out great
they are comfortable for as long as i wear them which has been many hours at a timethe cables are too long which seems to be the case with any heaphones ive seen so thats something to live with
for the price i dont think they can be beatnot a lengthy review
just my  to tell everyone whos curious aboutthese koss plugs as i was a week agovery comfy in my ear
stay put wo fallingoutgreat sound deep bass  i still hear the highs toobrings my mp player alive at lastthe free extra set of rubberfoam tips is greatmine came in black although any of the available colorslook great imoi started to buy the newer version of the koss earplugscalled the sparkplug but after reading alot of userreviews opted to buy these insteadthey are well worth the 
dont hesitate if youre considering thisbrand
they have a lifetime guarantee no questions askedyoull be glad you got themhard to believe that some other brands sell for upwards of several hundred dollarsthey simply cant sound much if any better than these do
periodthese are great ear buds
if you squish the foam down and quickly put them in your ears they expand and fit to your ears
helps to block outside noises and makes them comfortable
they feel secure and dont fall out if im moving around
great for people who like to walk around with an ipod
great bass which is really important to mei wrote a long review about all the benefits of these eaplugs but then i figured  im the jillionth person to review these
im not sure i can add anything so ill make this quickcool earphones
work great cost nothing totally camouflagednot sure
buy both kindsthank yougood base and good sound
i buy one and usually send them back to koss for  lifetime warranty when they crap out
im a heavy user and use these virtually every day anywhere from   hoursdayi always get sore ears from the standard earbuds that ipods provide
ive got smallerthannormal ears and the buds are really painful after a while
these koss headphones are like little sponges that you squeeze when putting in
then they expand to fit the exact size of your ear
fantastic
they also have great sound
definitely worth orderingi have tried many brands but the koss have been my favorite for years yes they die but i use them during workouts runs etc
i would say i go through about year and think they are well worth it
i also have the gold kdx models two sent them for repairs and the customer service was nicethanksgood solid earbuds
the sound is surprisingly good really a step up from the cheap sony  earbuds
they are very comfortable and stay in your ear well
i cant stand the feeling of that coarse foam that is used on most headphones so these are a great alternative
also the  cord is nice compared to most other earbuds that only have a  cord
the only potential problem i see is that the cord is fairly small gage wire hope it doesnt break but they do have a lifetime warrantyi tried the expensive active noise cancelling thing in stores including bose and have always been disapoited that it should be more like noise dampening but definitively not cancellingsame thing with thisyou hear the outside world as you do when you use ear plugs ie
the noise is lowered but when you play the music particularly if you like to play it somewhat loud then you cant really hear anything from outside
for  i take that over the  stuff any day
the bass is a bit strong for my taste but i can adjust that on my mp player i must warn you though im not a audio file i like a good sound but thats about itso if you try headphones like some people taste winesthen forget about my reviewbut if you want something that blocks the outside noise enough i couldnt hear my loan mower while the music was playing at all
while you listen to your music and dont want to spend a fortune these things are great
ill be buying another set as soon as these die for surethese headphones have excellent sound quality especially in the bass ranges
the foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear even after hours
it requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion put it in your ear canal hold it and wait for it to expand then carefully remove hand but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit
the dark purple plastic is a little strange and they do look funny but that is a very minor detail
great productthese are actually a replacement
my first set lasted for a few year and needed another
best earbuds for the money hands downi needed some earphones that would be more comfortable and louder than the cheap earbuds i had
im very happy with these on both accounts and as a bonus they are much cheaper than a lot of the other optionsi dont know if they still come with a lifetime warranty but id buy them over again even if they didntits hard to find a pair of inear headphones that are rated  to  hz
and if my memory serves me correctly this design was groundbreaking and every one else copied them
ive always enjoyed the isolating aspect as well as the bass response from themive used the lifetime warranty a few times over the last  years and have had no problemsi think these work great
fit well sound is just fine and for the price ive not found anything remotely in the same league
i can only assume the part about tasting good as i have not eaten them myself but my cat has devoured several sets so my presumption is in a pinch wouldnt make a halfbad snackkoss the plug portable headphones are indeed best bang for your bucksthis product still after many years still on the market tells you that people are still buying them for their reliability and excellent sound qualitypros best sound for the money well balanced bass mids and highs good construction and comfort small enough to be tucked away very good sound isolation and can be used in high noise environmentscons no con really but if you feel uncomfortable you can always modify the unit with other inear foams just use google as your best friendnotethe new generation of koss plug has slightly more hiss when you have very silent music the signal to noise ratio comes into play when there is improper impedance matching i think it is due to the fact that they are now  ohms versus  ohms earlier
correct me if i wrongthis was my fathers day gift from my daughter my earlier koss plug earphones which i purchased  years back which still works had very disgusting foam material due to daily use and abuse which my daughter could not tolerate seeing me squeezing that dirty foam into my ears made her buy me a new set of earphones
the new foam materials are better and hope this will last a decade just as the otherbuy with confidence these are excellent earphonesi bought these for my husband since he has sensitive ears
he loves themi bought these in january  and the ones i got are apparently the new version
theres no mute button or detachable headband as on the previous version and the claimed frequency response has been improved to  to  hz
they are inexpensive and come with a limited lifetime warrantyas far as sound quality it is very good
more importantly they block all background noise so that i can actually hear the music when im sitting at the back of a bus or in a noisy location
i prefer to listen to music at a quiet volume and its nice not to have to blast my eardrums out just to hear the music
the fit is very secure which i also like i always felt like my ipodstyle headphones were going to fall out of my earsloud as hell
and sound proof to the world
you wont hear much past whats pumping through your headphones
bass is nice and deep
sharp sound
not for anyone that doesnt like things in their ears
best part if you are a deaf fella like myself you can pop the foam off of these and the tubes are the perfect fit for your old hearing aid in ear molds
can get that perfect fiti bought this for me
but my kids love them so much i have to buy a send set
they are that goodfor an earbud these are amazing
the sound quality rivals much larger heavier and more expensive traditional circumaural earphonesthey key is being sure you position them properly
youll know when you do because bass notes easily roll off when the seal and orientation of the plug is wrong
to get the most out of these compress the foam by rolling it in your fingers and immediately put them in your ears
twist gently to seat them and you will be rewarded with good clear soundthe lifetime warranty is a plusfor the price these represent a truly great valuethese babies sound pretty sweet for 
dont waste your dough
get these and turn down the bass on your ipod set eq to electronica theyll sound frickin sweeti now own three pair of these  they are a bargain as i have dozens of earbuds mostly in ear and their efficiency and sealability give a full rich sound
the only pair i ever broke  was a pair that i sent through the wash twice
you will spend at least  times their price to beat them
one audiofile stated that he felt another set was much better at   again best value given their  price and performancefor a younger person with perfect hearing these might have less fidelity than others
however these are extremely comfortable
the isolation from the outside noise is better than most other ear bud style phones
and they dont have the fall out problems associated with typical ear buds
koss sparkplug earphones are also worth consideration
the sparkplug model earphones sound about the same but have a little higher profile out of ones ear reviews later ill sum up the critical reasons why i absolutely love these stereophonesive tried a lot of different earbud headphones looking for that obnoxious over the top chestpounding heart attack bass sound that typifies my favorite style of music drumnbass
they all fell far far short compared to the plug
i was even willing to spend the big money on those shures and etymotics but ive read they are weak with bass as well
dont bother with those sony ex fontopias
they were a huge sonic disappointment and they have that stupid long rightshort left cable arrangement
not these puppies
symmetrical cables babybad parts eventually the foam cushions go bad from too much use and dont inflate the way they used to after being squeezed causing them to fall out and dampen that beautiful bass
i used to just buy a new set when this happened  year but i just found out about these plug mods so ill try that now ear wax buildup
eeewww
yes well what else did you expect
luckily the plugs lend themselves to a very easy clean if you have a paperclip or baby pin
but they do get very juicy pretty fast so dont buy these suckers used or try to share with your buddy purple color is lame no case provided and its gross sticking juicy buds in yr linty pants pocket and then putting em back in your earif you are some audiophile nerd who is more interested in highs than lows i cant recommend these at all
if youve ever said turn the bass down out loud to someone keep searching
but if you like the feeling of a big foam bullet gradually expanding in your ear like a snuggly pillow pick these up todayi love these headphones and have been using them for years
my kids  and  discovered them and now wont use any others
they are very comfortable and block out outside sounds when you are using them
only downside is that they arent very durable but koss give a lifetime warranty on them and you just have to pay for shipping to get them replacedi have purchased about  sets of these over the past few years
i keep them everywhere  car pc bag desk gym bag
they last forever they fit snugly they are great on the plane because they block the noise  and the price is terrific
unlike other sit in the ear products these stay
i ever wear them while riding the lawnmower with big ear protector headphones over them and it makes the work go faster and not seem like workthese earbuds are the solution to all of your travel needs
lets face it public or commercial transportation is not known for its quiet atmosphere
im sure you will agree that you are always trying to raise the volume high enough to drown out the background noise but the headphones just cant do it
the koss plug is the answeri spent  years in the air force and i have gone through three sets of these
these are the only headphones that i could use while riding on military cargo planes without wearing ear plugs and without cranking the volume to max
ever time i thought i found something better they never could reach the level of noise isolation that the koss plugs provide
the bass level is superior to every budget or midrange priced similar devices
if you dont mind wearing ear plugs these are perfect for you
if you dont like wearing ear plugs get over it these plugs are worth the the annoyancejust bought these  they isolate sound have very good highend are comfortable and stay in my ear most ear buds fall out
i also bought a pair of the coby cve ear buds because i thought theyd fit as well
sure enough they do but they sound terrible in comparison
in addition these have a lifetime no questions asked warranty  thats gold my friendalthough it costs twice as much in us funds im very satisfied
my first pair had a button to stop sounds and extra plugs plus a case
it broke two months after since i tied it to make it shorter
one side wasnt functionning well because of that
i used it in the plane and it blocked  of the engine noise
economy class really spikes your ears so they should sell these in airports
also the plastic dried upi dont know why
my tip never tie the wires
it causes the metalic wires inside to break
because of this it costs me hundreds of dollarsmy second set was simpler but at the same price as my first
no more annoying button to stop music
the tube that you see when you removed the plugs was mostly rubberunlike totaly in plastic so its improved
the extra plugs where all different sshapes and sizes so there are some that i cant use
the main problem is that sometimes i sleep on my side while wearing them and the plug breakssecond tip i have two versions blueyellow and purplegray
what you get in the package is sorta different so choose carefully
the mute button can be easily pressed so its a small hintthird tip if it doesnt fit change the plugs or turn and push it in your ear
it doesnt really fit when only pushedfourh tip smaller plugs are better for best sound proof and qualityfinally the plugs with break down piece by piece until it doesnt fit if you unplug and plug them often
the mute button was meant for that if it helps you purchaseill only buy these kind of earphones since its like plugging your ears with rubber corks and istening to music at the same time
the price in canada is kinda steep if you buy it here you save with the currency and taxesi bought these because of the isolation feature
i needed some earplugs because riding in a helicopter is just boring without music
i can ride in a blackhawk or chinook and listen to these at a comfortable volume without hearing too much of the engine noise
a very minor thing is if you use these while running you will  hear yourself breathe a little louder than normal
its semi annoying but im used to it now
would definately recommend for the price and qualityfor the price you pay these are pretty good headphones
fit better than most in your ears and last forever
not the best you will find but for listening to books or music on walks or traveling they work perfecttry to get the metallic silver and purple in color koss plug earbuds as the sound is phenomenal for the price
i had a fairly expensive pair of sony earbuds that were around  and one channel crapped out after about  months
hard to believe but the koss plug earbuds sound way better then the more costly sony
go figurefor the price and the sound these earbuds cant be beat
good going kossthese are great little headphones for the price
theyre just like foam earplugs
there is a proper way to squish and insert earplugs believe it or not
most people just press a couple times without any thought and shove
you have to roll these between your fingertips really well evenly over and over
if you dont they will expand too fast and youll have trouble especially when new
the more you use them the better they get until the foam finally breaks down and you go to the replacement foam
i only use these when traveling and they knock down the noise down from planes considerably
these are your best bet for the money
ignore the reviewers that state that their double and triple priced headphone are better
duh
what would you expect
if you buy a car for  dont expect  or  dollar features and performance
someone actually compared these to  dollar shure headphones
also any selfproclaimed pretentious audiophile that buys these for  bucks and expects audiophile performance is just being ridiculous
come back to earth please
i have used these on all forms of media and have yet to be disappointed
they will definitely show the flaws in any recordings because the sound is isolated and aimed directly at your eardrum
this is one reason i would never give it to a little kid
if you like to save space on your ipod and go with a low quality setting your mistake will be painfully obvious
it will also be painfully obvious when you listen to the some of the cheaplow quality recordings and incompetent audio engineers of latethese will not fit everybodys ears on the entire planetbetter than i could have hoped
they are comfortable sound great and are an incredible deal from one of the best names in sound
makes my ipod touch the music machine i always wantedthese headphones to me are my favorite after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear
they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass
plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damagedfor  by far the best choice for portable applications particularly when theres a moderate level of ambient noise
excellent for walkman or mp player use at the gym they block enough sound so that i can hear the music but i can still hear if someone is talking to me although i have to remove at least one of the plugs in order to hear what theyre sayingbe sure to save the spare ear foam pieces  youll probably need them eventually since they dont fit as well after they soften up too muchthe ear buds make nice ear plugs
i wear them at work to block out noise
sound quality is good but not the best
they came with  different sized buds
i think they are a good value for the pricein no means are these headphones studio quality
these are for the person on the go and no i dont mean running
the foam snuggles fits in the ear canal and does do a very good job a cancelling out noise
the base is okay but you can always get a mini amp to create more bass or go into a devices settings to increase it
i did this on my iphone gs and i was please with the results
other than that it is a neat little accessory for my music tasteso far so good
perfect volume control
i highly recommend itworks great for metal detectors that dont have volume controli was looking to control the volume out of my samsung uneh which has a fixed volume output out of the mm jack
i wanted to used headphones when watching blurays or playing  so i got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier
works beautifully no noise and the volume is sufficient
excellent product for this type of usethe product works as advertised and is very simple to use
i am using it to control the volume on an external speaker connected to a spirit box for use in investigations for my paranormal research groupi just got these today and so far they are exactly what i wanted
i have read some reviews about the sound quality being bad when you turn it down low
honestly if your turning your music down that low then your obviously tyring to pay attention to other things
i tried my headphones with the controller on and off and i dont hear a difference
it is a delicate thing
very light
my only complaint is that i wish the volume control wheel was a little longer but it is something i can easily deal with
i will update in a few months or if something happensworks as advertised well worth money spent koss makes great products for the home or car so if you want or need a volume control then this one is for youi bought this so that i could easily control the volume on my ipod touch during bike rides and it does the job perfectlyi connected the speakers in my hot tub to my computer so i needed a volume control at the hot tub  works perfectlyworks great and im glad i got this with the purchase of my new audiotechnica ath anc headphonesconstruction isnt that heavy duty but if you want to reduce the output of electronic stereo devices to match the input of what youre connecting it to  it works
price was right and is convenient for my purposes
i recommend it  all things consideredthe product works as advertized
the adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely
the wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage
the cord is perhaps thinner than i would have expected but should be ok  the body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough
if the product proves to be durable i will change my rating to a   i recently updated the review to a  star rating
i have had no issues with this adapteri loved this when i had it but i unfortunately lost it when i was out one day
i primarily used it to make my headphones at the time longer so i could lay down in bed and watch tv
it did not affect the volume or quality
i also used it to make my earbuds longer while i was on the go i primarily use public transportation so i could put my mp player in my bag and simply use the volume control as needed since i would clip that part to my pants or my bagi plan on getting a replacementthis is my second one i could never get my first one from my wife so i needed to buy one for myself  it works well and is relatively inexpensiveit is a great buy for the money and i have had several other koss products before and alway been very satisfied with themi have one of these between my carpc and amp input
the soundcard was putting out to much power turning the volume up to  out of  on the pc would almost blow the speakers
this thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the pc volume
i havent noticed any sound quality loss though i dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detailthis inline volume control can be used in several situations
as a wearable it has a clip like on a pen so you can attach it to a pocket sleeve or collar so it wont be flopping around like a cord mounted control
in my case i used a small piece of double sided tape to inconspicuously mount it to the side of a table next to my chair to control the volume of the earbuds i wear while watching tvthe volume control range is from full off to full on and there is no static when operating the control and no distortion in sound quality at any settingmy only very minor complaint is that the control wheel is a bit too recessed so you have to only use the tip of your finger
thats probably a plus if youre wearing it as its less likely to be moved by just brushing against itits well worth the price and i would buy it againi have the controller on the outside of my motorcycle helmet
its hooked up it a pyle headphone amp and xpro speakers
absolutely no issues with this controller
it would even work great if i was an idiot and was doing  on my bike but i would never do thatthis review is for the koss volume control onlya volume control that i can reach anytime and it worksa volume control for all devices and it has the mm miniplug
the control includes a clip to attach it to any clothing toothis is the best separate volume control i have found
i use it with my headphones and control volume on all my devices with it
it makes changing the volume very easy
mine did come with a straight plug on the end instead of the angled plug as shown in the imagethis volume control worked better than i expected
i can now control the volume on each device i use with the same control
instead of trying to remember all the volume controls and where they are i plug this into my headphones and use it with everything
other than the plug being straight there were no surpriseshaving tried many volume controls both separate and integrated i found this one very easy to use
it is much better than most of the controls out there
set the volume up fairly loud and then use this to control it as needed
it works greatif you have a device that allows for headphones but doesnt have a volume adjustment this is for youive been using this to tone down the audio that is sent from my xbox s audio dongle
the volume control has lasted well since the purchase with no visible signs of wear in spite of being used while traveling
also the sound quality is pretty good with no detectable leakagei would greatly recommend thisi have a koss pro a plus headset that delivers incredible sound reproduction but doesnt have an inline volume control
i was considering ordering another headset with inline volume control but was reluctant to do so because of the quality of my current pros
searched on amazon and found this koss vc volume control which is the perfect companion to my headsetas one of the other reviewers rightly stated this device in not an amplifier
therefore please note the following  one has to turn up the sound on the output device an imac in my case connect the vc  volume control to this device connect the headset to the the vc  and then adjust the sound to ones liking
very simple to do
this makes for a superb listening experience
works on a computer ipad iphone etc and can be used if jogging exercising or just walkingive been a fan of koss for years because of the quality of their products
this volume control carries on their commitment of making quality products
very pleasedi bought this to be able to control audio volume
similar devices of other brandsno brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated koss is built much better and so far so good
no complaintsi bought this to control the volume of my audiotechnica m headphones which have no inline volume control
the headphones are very loud when plugged directly into the computer when the system volume is any higher than  so having a mechanical limiter like the vc is essentialso far i have no real complaints
initially i was skeptical about the thin dial but ive grown to like it  its easy to find by feel in the dark but difficult to bump accidentallythe plug end is a little skimpy but since the control will live by my computer im not worried about durabilityi cant give a scientific opinion about the sound quality  im sure theres some quality loss introduced by putting this device between the source and the headphones but im unable to discern a difference
the sound coming from my ms is still very nicei wish it had a mute button but for the price i cant complainthis allows me to control the volume on my head phone instead of have to use the mouse on the laptopi like it alot
is also used when hooked up to the headphones for the tv or the mp player
very convenientrecommend
works greatuse headphones with the speaker output on my tv
there is no volume control on that output
added this inline before my headphones
works perfectif you have a television that does not give you variable output to headphones this is what you need
it words simply said better then i thoughtdigital portable radios drive me crazy with the huge change in volume that comes with one unit of volume increasedecrease
i use this to adjust radio volume through headphones in a more useful way
all is welli often buy headphones with builtin volume control
but the brand and style i really like is no longer available
i discovered this inline volume control realized it would work with any standard headphones using a  inch plug and i couldnt be happier
if i need extra cord length for my phones this gives it
and i will always prefer a hardware volume control to a software one
its just so much quicker and easier to deal withi use it with zoom h portable recorder i had a serious issue with zoom that its intake level is very hot
so whne you get a line out from a mixer you have no way to control the input gain
this is perfect for that
also it is very clean sound definitely worth getting
comes in handy when you cant control the volume what youre listening to as you would expectworks great
cant say much else about this product other than write filler words so i can hit the submit button got itwhat can one say about this simple but much needed accessory
koss vc volume controlbest one i have ever usedever use an accessory rotary volume control if you can find one
they usually work for a week get a speck of dust inside then become choppy or silentmost headphones are furnished with a rotary volume controlthe better headsets of course usually have the better quality controlhowever the controls drop dead just before the headphones doi mow acres  acres of lawns all season longlots of dust  polleni use the koss vc every day going on two years
if it gets dirty a tiny squirt of deoxitand it springs right back
amazing durability from an  componentwonderful very useful
my old portable radio and hardly responds to the volume control and i have returned to this attachment to use with headphones and volume control againas the night wore on the fm became static ridden
i followed earlier reviews popped the cover  screws and counterrotated the vr about th turn
the signal improved dynamically and the static was gonethe koss vc volume control works very well
at very low volume i would say less than  of max
it gives sound only in the left canal but thats really not a problem
i didnt notice any sound distortion otherwiseit has a small metal clip which can be removed ie
torn off for the users who might find it problematicjust exactly what i was looking for
satellite box audio output was unadjustable and very loud
this fixed the problemdoes exactly what it should
i use it with a blue tooth receiver to work as wireless headphones with a set of ear buds
no noise on changing volume levels long lasting wear at night so subject to toss and turn
the variable resistor must be of some quality in that it hasnt started making noise yet
most cheap volume controls potentiometers start making noise after a short whilei already have two no name inline volume controls but i needed another
this koss unit was no more expensive from amazon than another no name from an electronics store and ive been a big fan of koss since the late s so i bought itfirst what it is and isnt
this is a volume control but not an amplifier
it will make your mp player etc quieter but not louder
if your source is too quiet look for a headphone amplifierwhen i used to listen to a cassette walkman it was easy to turn down the volume when i needed to
the volume control was a thumbwheel right on the player
i have several mp players now and they all have hitech context sensitive controls
this means for me anyway that i have to look at the screen to make sure the button or slide control is set for volume
this control solves that problem
set the player for a volume slightly on the loud side and use the inline control to get comfortable sound
if you need to lower the volume to talk to someone for instance you can use the volume control without taking your player out of your pocketthis model has a three foot cord between the player and the volume control
this is nice if your player has an fm tuner  mp players use the headphone cord as an fm antenna
my generic ones were only about  inches long and the fm reception sufferedthe control has a clip on it so you can wear your player safely in a padded pouch on your belt and clip the volume control to your chest pocketa few reviewers have noted that lowering the volume attenuates high frequencies
i tried using the eq settings on my player i was also using koss portapro headphones
when i had bass boost eq settings i did notice some high frequency attenuation in both the koss and generic inline volume controls when the eq was turned off i didnt notice as much high frequency attenuation but the sound was very flat
anyway i dont think i would have noticed it if other reviewers hadnt pointed it outan inline volume control is very handy for portable mp players etc and this unit is well thought out and works greatthis is something you probably wont fully appreciate until youve had one for a while and then lose it
you may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control
but once you get used to having one youll find the convenience and functionality are habit forming
the one i lost was in daily use for  or  years and continued to work welli bought this to hopefully remove a very audible hissing sound from an htc evo v phone
the hiss could be heard easily when i was playing mp files regardless of which pair of earbuds i used
i inserted my earbud plug into the the koss vc and then plugged the vc into my phone
after turning the volume on my phone up and the volume on the vc down i was thrilled to find that the hiss was no longer audible
i noticed no degradation in sound quality same bass and treble levels for example when using the vc versus not using it
the gadget is lightweight and offers excellent control over sound volume
well worth the pricethis handy audio extension really helps while watching videos on the kindle fire
offers an external volume controlhighly recommend this koss unit to anyone who has noticed the modest volume output for the kindle fire
this is smaller than my earbuds when both are wrapped upi listen to my tv once in a while using my bose qc headphones
the problem with that set up is that volume cannot be adjusted and plays at full blast
the koss vc volume control module mitigated that issue
works as describedthis is a surprisingly useful gadget as it serves as an extension cord and volume control
the extension cord aspect adds about  feet to your headphone which gives me a lot more room to move when i am listening to music on my computer
the volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the playeri use a radio to put me to sleep at night
i plug a pillow speaker into my radio or smartphone to listen to talk radioit is a lot easier to control the volume with this that waking up my smart phone and using the volume control on itmy wife watches a lot more tv often using headphones so that i can avoid the incessant prattle of tv
this allows her to control her earphones that are powered by the tv audio output
the audio output is always on but doesnt have a volume controleconomical way to make any headphones volume controllable
works great and delivery was swift
although it is compact it seems sturdy enough to last for yearsif you have audio equipment that doesnt have a volume controlfor some odd reason then this does the trick to fix that problemif you want a buffer between you and the audio source get this product
well made and it will save your hearingthe koss vc volume controller really does what its suppose to
not really much else to say about it honestlygreat item
used for night time sleeping
operation by roller dial easy and efficient item will buy a second for spareusing inline with my sennheiser headphones
control wheel in cavity of housing so vol
control wont get accidently turned and it stays where you set it
good volume range easy to set to right level
cord a bit long when adding to my already long earphones cord but i just coil up the volume control extra 
good  plug fit one end and strain relief on other end at cord
getting another for my koss headphones
clip on it to affix to like a beltthis product performs as advertised
i use it to connect a bose quiet comfort headset to my computer for gaming and such to not annoy others nearby
makes it much easier to control the volume with a physical wheel then through windows
not much else to say about itso i loved the one i purchased for home so much that i purchased another for my headphones at work  simple does what it says and a nice cheap pricea good little tool to have around the house especially when gaming
i can plug this into the computer then my headphones into it then adjust the volume from there without having to alttab to change the volumethe cable feels cheap and it is a thinner cable but so far ive had no issues
the volume control is good there is no hiss or distortion when adjusting volume
im rather picky with audio and i havent had any issues there is no interference or sound distortion that i can tell
i highly recommend iti have a sole elliptical that has built in speakers and an input for mm stereo plug
it does not however have a built in audio control
running straight from my roku player to the elliptical was too loud and from the tv too low
this works perfectly connecting my roku player to the elliptical now that i can control the volumekoss vc volume control unit
does exactly what it says it does exactly as it expected
no more no lessthis item works very well and gives provides convenient volume control for headphones portable speakers ipods etc
easy to use i highly recommend themthis is a handy and inexpensive little device
a convenient way to tweak your volume level
works fine
no complaints
like all headphone cables it doesnt like to be rolled over by chair rollers stomped on or yanked out of the socket
if you treat it with moderate care it ought to last for yearsthis koss is very good one for volume control
there is no noise sound when i adjust volume
i cant distinguish whether i plug my headphone with this koss because it has no effect to my head phone at all
i use hd which has  ohms impedance so i think this koss may reduce some power of my headphone
but not at all
my hd still provides great sound
i love itnice product
exactly what i was looking for
quality is great but it does not have any type of pause button on it
it is strictly a volume control onlymy needs were simple to lengthen the audio cord so i didnt have to worry about how i sat at work and volume control
i sit at the computer a bit from time to time and like to stream musicthe cord is long enough about ft i believe
the volume control is just that basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out but it means i can adjust it rather than adjusting the volume on the computerit does everything it is supposed to and in a small package
worth the purchasenot much to write this is a great addition for those headphones which dont have their own volume control and you dont want to mess with the windows volume or your music player volumei just put them on high and control the volume through this insteadrecommendedthis does the task it is supposed to do
it provides an inline volume control for headsets that do not have one
i realize that many headsets are available that have this built in
however we have several nice pair of headsets without this feature
rather than replacing expensive headsets i bought this to make it easier for me to change the volume without fiddling with controls on the computer or ipodi ride a scooter aka vespa and it is inconvenient to reach the volume control of my mp player while im riding so i decided to buy this and so far im pleased
i love how i can clip it on my shirt and easily access it
one thing to mention is that it does not amplify sound so it will only go as loud as the music player can go
i believe there is no degradation in sound quality so that is great
overall id recommend it based on my experiencewhen you set the volume on your music player it goes in steps and is hard to get the loudness you want
this helps fine tune your volume to the exact spot you want it
i really recommend this so you can get the volume you wanti like good quality in the ear speakers but not all of them have the volume control on the wire leads
i bought a set of klipsch in the ear speakers with no volume control
having the inline control is a must for me because i wear them under my ear muff hearing protection when shooting pistol at the conservation club i belong to
so with the noise canceling ear speakers and the hearing protection muffs i need to turn the volume down without pulling out my smart phone when  someone is trying to talk to me
they work well and i cannot hear any difference if the ear speakers are directly plugged into my music source or if they are going through the volume control
i would recommend these to anyone that is looking for an in line volume control deviceim using this item in line for a set of wired headphones for a tv
the output from the tv is fixed so i needed to have a volume control in line so i could turn down the volume on the tv so i could watch and leave the room quite
this control gave me a couple more feet of length and it works flawlessly
i wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone
im using the same headphones i use with my ipodaddendum ive had my volume control for a year now and it continues to work very well
i use it everyday and ive had no problems with it
i saw one reviewer that complained it was hard to use i cant imagine how that could be
the control wheel is recessed into the unit but is easy to use by just sliding your thumb over the wheel
ive found it to be very robust once it attached to the end of my headphones the unit reaches to floor but its well made and has taken a beating with any problemsthese external headphone or ear bud volume controls are dificult to find
this one works very well
wide range of volume control
note that miniplug is straigt and not angled as shown in photo of product
actually i wanted the straight plug
only wish that the small pocket clip was removeable
minor detail howeverwhile not the use most likely intended for this koss device i purchased it for my mom so she could control the sound from her tv whether to a pair of headphones or a small powered speaker in her lap
its perfect and allows her to keep her own personal volume while not having the tv set itself so loud as to blast out the rest of the room
i have also tried it on my ipod and its a much more convenient way to trim the volume than fumbling for the touch screen or wheel
i believe the claims on the box to boost the volume of your personal device may be less than accurate at least in my case but it certainly works well enough for the obvious purposevery good volume controller and very useful have it on my pc works with any head phones does the job it was made for and works greati got the koss volume control mainly because i listen to books when i walk and the traffic often makes it difficult to hear
being able to just adjust the volume with the koss volume control is much easier than pulling out my ipod or mp player to do it
it also conserves the battery by not having to adjust it on the player
this works exactly like it is advertisedi purchased this volume control simply to give my headphones an extension cord
being able to adjust the volume is an added bonusi have a very nice set of stereo headphones which for reasons i cannot understand does not include an inline volume control
i purchased the koss vc to insert in the playback circuit when i needed an inline volume control
the device works perfectly just as it is supposed to
the only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive  only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers
overall im totally satisfied with this producti think every pair of headphones should have builtin volume control but a lot of them dont so this bit of kit is needed
they work just as expected with no degradation to the sound qualitythis volume control is just what i needed to control the volume for headphones i own without a volumecontrol
the control is simple and the volume changing is continuous and smoothi have bought two of these one for myself and another for a gift
i like having the thumb wheel volume control handy to raise and lower volume while watching movies on my pad
it is a very solid productim very happy with this extention
not only does it giveme the extra length to use it for remote viewing thru my pc from bed it is very convenient for volume i have complete privacy and control of my utube and netflix viewing late at night i wasnt sure but it turned out to be a great buyit works as advertised its nice and small and adds a little length to your existing headphone cord
mine doesnt look exactly like the one pictured its more squared off than rounded but no big deal im still pleased with it and do recommend itthis works great
i have a mp player that i use when i am riding and it makes it easier to adjust the volume
fast shippingi have a koss headphone but leaning back in my chair was not quite long enough plus the volume control is very handy to make a quick volume control when needing to make quick volume controls as well as getting some more space
the quality is very good with the headset and volume controlits so convenient having a volume control for my earphones
i use this when watching my tv since there is no volume control for the earphone connection
i may order another one for use with my ipod so i wont have to dig it out of my purse to adjust the volumei use this with my bluetooth headphones the volume control is great which is what looking for in this product the extra cable length is a bonusthe cable is thin but appears to be a high quality
connectors are well builtthe volume control is easy to use and will let you fine tune the volume to any lower volumei love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones i use
also the cord is long enough to work as an extension
ive always enjoyed koss products the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most especially for the pricethis is more accurately called a volume limiter
it can only decrease volume and cannot increase the volume from your device
this is a very simple device that acts as a throttle on the volume provided by the output of your device
it connects to the output of your device an earphone jack and then provides a connection for earphones or speakers
once the connection is made the inline rheostat can reduce the volumeit does that very well and does not seem to add any static
the controller operates smoothly up and down
i use this between my laptop and an amplified set of speakers
i set my laptop to  output and the amplifier to  which turns out to be very loud with the controller in the max position
i then use the controller to reduce and increase volume without having to touch the laptop or the amplifierwhen connected to my phone i set the volume to high and reduce it as needed with the controller
it saves having to activate the screen and taking the phone in and out of my pocket
it is very handy and the extra cord length is handy for short corded earphoneshave used item very little but pleased with it
i would recommend to anyone with need of such a devicethis year i bought a dell vostro laptop
it turns out that manyall have a problem with the audio in that there is a buzzing sound and noise  especially when using earbud headphones
someone suggested using a volume control to increase the impedence
i didnt expect it to work but it does
the koss vc reduced the problem to the point where it is barely perceptable
i am completely satisfiedused for under the pillow stereo speaker
also added a small headphone amplifier between this volume control and audio source
would recommendplease note this will not make your music louder
it will simply control the volume  thats it
now that ive said this lets move oni love this little device
it works great with my samsung s and poweramp app
sometimes i get tired of taking my samsung in an out of my pocket just to adjust the volume  as there are some songs a bit louder than others like there are some commercials on tv that are louder than others
well i dont have to do that any longer
i have the koss volume control clipped on the wire part of my sony headphones and im good to go
i owned one before but i must have lost it during relocating and i was really missing it
i will update this review if any problems arise from this devicewell this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality  
and for the price that its offered
i can recommend any one to just buy it  without thinking twice
cons   not as comfortable as over the ear headphonesi had a koss cd player when i was little and the bass was unmatched in a bookshelf system
it made me the envy of my friends and translated into loyalty with koss headphones
i cant say enough about these lightweight gorgeoussounding funky headphones
portapros have a lifetime warranty look like something out of tron and spoil the listener with comfort and bass reproduction
buy em and find something else to worry about in life
highly recommendedim on my second pair of these headphones
im no audiophile  just a gym rat who uses them every day to drive my workoutsconsidering the class of headphones under  that i have used for this onethe good features  great sound light on head excellent bang for the buckthe bad features  i carry them in my gym bag along with my other stuff
the cord gets tangled up half the time
also after some time  years the ear cushions become shredded and must be replacedjune   update
i have purchased another pair and im very impressed
new headphones needed since the previous pair would intermittently drop the signal
the cord seems shorter and it is thicker so it only gets a little tangled
also the ear muffins appear larger
for the price i know of nothing thats better
a great buythere are enough reviews here to keep you busy for a few hours so i will only mention a few points i had the sportapros
they sound great too same drivers but the portapros are really worth the extra  or so bucks youll spend on them
the pps are much more robust and look better imho
just spend the extra cash you wont be disappointed no questions asked lifetime warranty they sound fantastic for most of us average joes who love music and tend to boost bass and treble on eqsthey are worth every pennyi was little skeptical about buying this one
portapros are produced all the way since the s and have a flimsy look
my doubts continued as i was unpacking my portapros
could this little flimsy plastic set of headphones be that good
all of my doubts have evaporated once i have tried using them
these headphones have two big pros sound quality one thing you should be aware of is that these headphones are loud
i have compared them to my sennheiser hd and sony mdra
there is no comparison
portapro is much louder
of course if you dont like it you can turn down the volume
however despite the loudness the sound is excellent
i can pick a lot of details in my music cds that were nearly undetected with the mdra and barely audible with the hd
when i play first person shooter games i am getting excellent directional sound
comfort the comfort is excellent
the headphones sit very tightly on my head and yet they dont apply much pressure to my ears
i can wear my portapros for hours without feeling any discomfort
the reason for this is that these headphones come with extra cushions the sit above your ears and shift some pressure to your head leaving very little pressure on ears
you can also choose how much pressure you want to have applied to your ears
if the default is too much you can shift some of that pressure to the auxiliary cushions by changing the comfort zone  settings the blue buttons above the driver its best to start playing with them once you already wear the headphones
since the headphones sit tight on your head theyre suitable for outdoor or gym use
the cable length is just right to reach your pc speaker or mp player about  feet but i suppose that some people will find it too short
finally the set folds easily and fits into a small leather bag provided for portabilityand have i mentioned lifetime warranty
if they ever break just send them to koss with a  check
theyll fix or replace them for you
overall i am very satisfied and would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs cheap reliable headphones with good sound quality for either indoor or outdoor usemany of my friends look at these headphones and wonder why i make such a big deal about them
they are not the most beautiful headphones to look at
but do they kick xxx when it comes to sound there are not another pair it this price range that even comes close i have a pair of sennheiser px  headphones which i bought a couple years ago use for listening to music videos etc on my pc or sansa
however they were never really very suitable for jogging or biking in not a tight enough fit and will come loose during excessive movementthe bud type earphones just dont cut it for me  uncomfortable and sound quality just crappy
i wonder why most other people are happy to wear bud type phones
maybe my ears are deformedanyways i googled the web and found several good reviews of these koss phones for runningi bought a pair a couple of months ago and i must say that its one of the best buys i have ever madethe sound quality of the koss portapro is excellent and slightly better than my sennheiser px s
they fit very snugly and feel very light when running and that plus the excellent sound quality make them a great buyone feels very happy when you have paid a small amount of money for great quality and great soundnow when im sitting at my pc and need phones for listening it becomes a bit more of a toss up
the koss sound quality is great and with a snug fit
the sennheiser px  although not quite as good sound quality have a very light feel to themfor walking running and  general moving around  these koss phones are the way to gomay  updatethese guys are holding up well despite some pretty rugged treatment  highly recommendedi bought a pair of these while i was in new york  i bought them from one of the big cameragear brokers there and paid about  for them
i bought them because my iems are too dangerous to wear on city streets and my akg ks are too big to wear out
so these seemed like a happy medium
theyre very durable they have excellent bass for something this size and they have a cool retro look
with the lifetime guarantee im comforted in the idea of getting them replaced if i should accidentally break them
so far so good though  months laterive been using this headphone for a few monthsfor the build  it looked filmsy but even i havent been using it very carefully its still working well no parts brokenfor the sound quality the bass is very good midrange is good
i hope the high range could be a bit clearer
meanwhile i found that this headphone is quite musical no harsh high range and enjoyable to listen to especially for piano music easy listening and jazz music
still the high range could be a bit improved but at this price range its very okayi usually use ear buds or speakers but i thought i would try these
the bass and the sound response in general are quite good
they are seemingly flimsy or should i say light weight but i have been pretty hard on them and they are still in one piece
i would recommend them over similarly priced ear buds so long as the style appeals to youive been using these headphones since  ive owned many pairs but koss has a no questions return policy one time even sending me a new pair because i inquired about replacement ear pads
the sound that these cans put out are second to none
i flirted with grados and other expensive headphones but always run back to these
the look is very s retro because they are unchanged by popular demand since their introduction and they bring warm deep sound to anything you plug them into
ear buds are for idiots
step up to a pair of these babies and youll be stoked at the sound they put outi bought a pair of these over  years ago
they still work and more important sound fantastic
ive replaced the ear pads due to age but thats itwhat stands out about these today just as it did back in the early s is the true high fidelity sound quality  including true extended bass
from low bass through the highest treble these are well balanced and natural sounding
more money will buy a headphone that excels in one area but to truly outperform these overall is getting up there
to add more transparency to the musical reproduction is going to just plain cost you  and they will be a larger setin closing i misplaced my pair since found and spent  on a pair of well respected affordable akgs
these sound betterhighly recommendedthese are one of the best headphones that can be bought for the moneypros great sound i listen to rock and pop mp music mainly and that sounds great
all friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the ipods are just amazed when they listen through this comfort
you just dont feel them on your head after some time lifetime warranty
i bought them at amazon in  was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly and all the foams were gone
i got them repaired absolutely free just paying the shipping costs and that too in india
they are like new now price
bought them for  at amazon portability is decent
they fold and dont take much spacecons sound leaks
i use them at office and cubicle mates sometimes tell me to lower the volume looks as others have said they definitely look awkwardoverall unless you want earbudsnoise cancelling phonesaudiophile quality you cannot go wrong with theseive been using these headphones for over a year now and theyre simply excellenti know some have an issue with the style but all i really care about is the sound qualityits terrificstop looking and just get these
they dont feel as comfortable as some other headphones but they sound greati love the retro look toothey are collapsible comfortable they have great sound quality good bass and they come with a lifetime warranty
how can you not buy thesei bought the sennheiser px and returned them since they hurt my head   hat size
these headphones sound better better range and low end fit better and cover more of my ears
solid valuemost anywhere on the web you can find these for between  to  bucks and they are well worth it
i tend to be a bit of an audio snob but im using these on a cell phone and occasionally an ipod
so i understand those arent going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full rangeeven with that being the case i was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these
you dont have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound
bass is very strong it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste
i listen to a wide range from classical to hiphop and for things like jazz and classical i find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced
this isnt to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these arent going to do as good as they would for something like mosdef for whom these are exceptional
the construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but i can live with that because im concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they areif good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and youll understand why theyre considered classics
for a  price you can get  soundive had my portapros for several years now and theyve served me very very wellpros best sound ive heard in a small portable headphone
my grado srs sound better but theres no way youd walk down the street in em fold reasonably well into a coatpocketable clump durable as heck other than the replaceable foam earpiece covers
i use the heck out of these and they take it in stridecons look pretty uncool foam earpiece covers need replacing every  or so uses  cheap and readilyavailable from koss takes a minute to doive owned these for  years and still like them
theyre a good compromise between tiny portable earphones and fullsize home headphones
they sound good and are apparently durable as ive been using the same pair for all these years
my only reservation is that the foam earpads tend to get damaged when you toss them in a bag with other items so use the case
i dont remember if mine came with one
also consider buying the replacement earpads
ive worn a couple pair out and damaged a couple pairits possible that those inear earphones have caught up in sound quality so consider those
im not in a hurry to replace my porta pros thoughthe first thing that needs to be said about these headphones is that they are really ugly
there can be no denying it
the weird earpieces with the bar atop is just ugly ugly ugly
that said these are easily the most comfortable portables ive worn a situation largely a product of the very features that make the set ugly
additionally the sound is good
i dont feel the sound is as orgasmically supreme as other reviewers suggest but the sound is very good
if you listen to a lot of jazz or classical some senns might serve you better
if you listen to more rock and hip hop youll be pleased with the portapros if only for the comfort which is truly exceptional
i use them with my ipod and am well pleasedthese are simply the best headphones that you can purchase for an under  price tag and they are under 
very full clear sound with an amazing amount of bass
the styling isnt the greatest in my opinion but the amazing sound quality more than makes up for itdespite looking like they are straight out of  these headphones sound like   amazing sound quality that matches my studio headphones with a durable onthego construction
base is solid highs are not peaky or harsh on the ears and the mids are smooth and warm soundingvery comfortable on the earsmy original pair stopped working and i sent them to koss and for  i had a brand new pair sent to me within  weeks
only complaint is that the way the metal band is designed with two pieces it can pinch your neck hair when sitting around your neck instead of on your head
minor complaint but it hurtsive been wearing these daily for about  months now and am extraordinarily pleased with them for the price
yes there is a caveat i paid  for these and for that price they have fit andor surpassed all of my expectations
i believe these can compete with any headphones in the lt range
i do have two complaints thoughaudio 
bass is powerful highs are clear mids are crisp enough
perhaps a little too well blended for rock not much emphasis on treble but fantastic for acousticinstrumental pieces and hip hopi dock  star because of the utter lack of sound isolation
having onear pads with no noise cancellation tech really means no noise cancelling duh
this is fine but it also unavoidably detracts from sound quality when there is any noise around you
the pads also bleed sound easily i had to be mindful even playing at half volume in publicaesthetic 
as authentically retro as you can get since they are literally from the sbuild quality 
simplicity makes for durability in this case for hurting your ears after a couple hours of wear
fortunately you can adjust the pads so they angle away from your ears shifting the pressure up to the side of your head
the springy metal band will allow these to fit any head size
 for the  degree input jack
straight jacks get bent out of shape too easily this design wont suffer the fate of many a pair of ipod earbudsfor the price there is no superior
that much i will assert strongly
if you want audiophile headphones and have over  to spend or want noise cancellation take the metro to schoolwork
you wont want to use these
then i advise looking elsewhere
if you are on a budget and want simple quality without the bells and whistles these are perfectly suited for you and you will enjoy uncompromising sound qualityhad these in college in the early s and now again a decade later
kind of a cult following of audiophiles fashion lovers and retro freaks back then and now
great punch and bass for a small and simple headphone
very good price from amazon for ish vs msrp  or even higher for limited edition colors or cable volume control
great alternative to ear buds or full cans somewhat portable because they can fold up but they are a little flimsy so i would not recommend packing them tightly or under heavy weight in luggage
obviously not closed so neighbors will hear your music at louder volumes
however this isnt a problem in louder public venues like the bus subway airport train stnetci have tried a lot of portable cans  everything ranging from cheap gumdrops all different beats up to bose noise cancelling  i always end up coming back to the koss porta pro
its can fold up into a small package like a mini transformer its comfortable  i never got hair stuck  unlike my akgs and the sound is amazing
bass is strong the mids are pretty good
its very good for current day music
it is very energy efficient  can set your iphone at halfway and still get good soundi wouldnt recommend it if your musical set is acoustics or other lighter genre however still much better than say stock budswork well and easy to use
the cord is to short but the sound build quality and weight are are outstanding
these headphones excel in these most important areas
i will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy setover the years ive not had the best luck with portable earphones
tired of the awful sound of default earbuds ive experimented with shure bose sennheiserklipsch andjvcbrands ranging in price from  to  but have never really been satisfied with sound signatures that were either too bassshy too muddy or cramped soundstage
eventually i got tired with the uncomfortable and often dirty world of earbuds and decided to go back into the world of onear portable phones
reading at headfi about thekoss ksc portable stereophone headphones i ordered them from amazon
while no match for myaudiotechnica ax headphonesat home i was impressed with the richness and spaciousness of the kscs but it wasnt long before i found the clips uncomfortable for my ears so after a couple of months i went ahead and ordered the kscs big brother the portaprosi couldnt be happier with my decision
the sound signature is very similar to the kscs but there is a touch more bass and depth
its not a flat analytical sound not too muddy but very fun and warm  perfect for portable listening around the office
theyre open phones so youll be able to hear your surroundings and anyone nearby will be able to hear what youre listening to at high volumes so bear that in mind
build quality is fair about what youd expect for the price range but the portapros are very light on my head
considering that their sound is superior to a couple pairs of  earbuds ive used ill take the trade in isolation for comfort and sound quality
im also a fan of the s stylingtheyre not perfect
in addition to the openness and build quality the headband occasionally pulls out a hair or two but it doesnt happen often enough to be burdensome
while the portapros fold down to a surprisingly compact ball getting them into the included travel pouch can be a tight fit
overall the negatives are greatly outweighed by the positivesif youre in the market for a modestlypriced portable set of headphones the koss portapros are highly recommendedthe portapro has apparently been around since  that in itself should tell you something about this product
i recently bought a notebook computer for around 
it has a gb hard drive
back in  i bought my first notebook
it had gb and cost 
in electronic product terms these should have been retired decades ago
there are good reasons they havent been though
the longevity of the portapro speaks volume about this producti am fortunate enough to have a soul by ludacris sb
it is a  headphone
i like it a lot
it produces an excellent all around balanced sound that brings out vocals and all instruments
the portapro does the same
the portapro actually sound better
the sound is breathtaking in its accuracy and clarity
they even leak less sound are lighter and require no batteries
the portapro bring an unbelievably accurate wellbalanced rich detailed and lush sound for the price
you are getting the music all of the music the way the artists wanted it to be heard
it isnt often a product can cost  to  times less than other good products but the portapro does
you can get new headphones and a new ipod or other mp player and spend less than other headphones and still have the better set of headphonesand they are very comfortable and light
the headphones themselves are well padded as is the adjustment bar above
and the adjustment bar works
i have it set in the middle of the comfort zone and get just the right amount of snugness
you also get virtually zero sound leakage
it makes the portapro the perfect work headphones fantastic sound virtually no sound leakage comfortable enough to wear all day very light foldable and storablethe only nitpicking i can do is that the headband is not padded and they look maybe a little goofy
but the goofy gives you that nice comfort zone
all in all a quite extraordinary product
if amazon had a product hall of fame where items made it for a combination of performance and value the portapro would be in it for sure
a great gift for yourself or a friend or family member
lastly before i bought these i did some research and they do have a lifetime guarantee
you can send them in and the shipping back costs a total of  from what people related on the internet
you can spend many times more for these and not get any added performance
thank you kossive occasionally read reviews about these over the years
but i irrationally felt from their appearance that they probably werent as good as so many people said they were
but indeed they are
as everyone discovers the experience of comfort and sound clarity in these matters can be extremely personal
on the basis of sheer discomfort alone i have greatly disliked every one of all the types of headphones i have ever tried until now
and anything inear is much worse
so i have simply been looking for somethinganything with decent sound quality that didnt cause my ears to burn and my entire head to ache after  minutes
now the long frustrating quest merely to find wearable headphones is over at last
what a reliefthese headphones are simply the best headsets ever made
clear highs deep lows
i have been using them for years and occasionally need to replace them
 at almost any store that sells them i found them on amazon for ive tried many other brands over the years and many price ranges including the noise canceling bose ones they hurt my ears
nothing comes closemy son destroyed the pair i bought here a few years ago so hes not touching these i bought these babies at a fye when i was just shopping around
i have read that they have amazing sound and you cant find a better sound for the money
man were the reviewers right
the soundstage is amazing with great highs and bass
the bass is delivered so well i cant find words other than impressive and intense especially for the size of these headphones
i must say they get better sound than headphones that range up to  and even more easily
i listen to a lot of s to s rock and all types of heavy metal and the sound is delivered powerfully
a d type of sound
also try the koss kscs for an even better performancepros price is unbeatable great balance of highs mids and lows ground breaking bass great soundstage separation of instruments a d sound cool s design sound doesnt need to be amplified it shouldnt be eithercons gets slightly uncomfortable to wear after a while  hour or so seems flimsy at times although it seems to be made of good material the casebag that comes with headphones is too small and a pain to get headphones in and out ofthese koss portapro headphones work great
normally the only thing i care about with headphones is how durable they are though ever since i became an adult and my head got bigger i suppose the size and comfort is another thing that needs to be taken into considerationi used to have really horrible luck with headphones back in the s
the headphones would always lose the volume in one side of the speaker so id have to constantly keep readjusting them and twisting the end piece attached to the stereo equipment to get the volume back
it was annoying
this problem still exists from time to time but these particular type of koss headphones havent been giving me this particular problem and im very happy about that
nothing worse than when your favorite moment of a song comes on and bam the volume drops out from one sidei highly recommend everyone purchase a pair of these headphonesfor what these cost they do what they do well
theyre very comfortable and conform to my head with the medium setting on the earpiece adjustment
as far as sound goes i havent had any complaints
they sound much better than similarly priced headphones that ive owned and these will be my permanent headphones for being out and aboutsound leaks of course but you could tell that from the image
overall i think these are the best headphone for the price range at the time of this review
theyve also been surprisingly durableoriginal review im getting ready for a three week trip with a lot of flying to south america so i thought id read the reviews for all the noise cancelling headphones out there and ended up buying the sennheiser pxcs they sound decent but compared to my cheapo koss portapros they suckthe koss portapro is simply the best lightweight travel headphone ive ever owned
im not sure why theyre so retro looking but theyre really comfortable and sound like high end headphones without being giant monsters the sound quality and the bass and volume levels are amazingdont question yourself buy these and try them out and youll be extremely happy that you did
updated   wow i cant believe i bought these in 
the earpads after almost  years need replacement
thats it
they still sound amazing when i put them on and they make music oh so enjoyable compared to earbuds not even  earbuds sound as good as these little ish s looking headphones and theyre now actually just retro enough looking and to me say hey those must sound awesome because theyre sorta ugly so i wear them proudly
dont hesitate plus you have  days to try them out thats why amazon is so awesomeit was my first plunge into the mp world and i felt that the key would be choosing the right headphones
following a good deal of research i believe i made the right choicethese koss portapros are lightweight with an excellent sound and the unique design makes them very comfortable
i have tried the bose  headsets  and if you fly alot theyre probably worth it for the sound dampening  effect  but if someone makes a better sounding set for less than twice as much  buy it
for  these are well worth the moneyu p d a t e purchased in january  ive been using these for  years now and have been through  or  sets of earpiece covers
they still sound great
one time i thought the bass had gone out on one side as it had an awful rattle but i cleaned it out  it was a hair against a speaker  and it sounded fine again
so check for debris before you toss yours outthese koss headphones have an excellent dynamic range and will support full rich sound in spite of their light weight
its easy to forget that youre wearing these because theyre comfortable and adjust well
they dont squeeze on the ears and head like a lot of headphones do but they stay put comfortably
i also like the way the headphones fold into such a small size they fit in a coat pocket or computer case pocket
while they look like they might be a little frail they seem to be pretty rugged
i have a few different sets of headphones and these became my instant favorite but great headphones period for any application
these are my favorite headphones  thats not to say theyre the most detailed accurate or will fool you into thinking theyre a set of stax or anything they are of course astonishingly accurate and detailed
no other headphones combine this level of comfort soundstage openness and plain excitement into such a compact durable and cheap package
these are tiny tiny tiny but rock out with authoritytheres been a lot of jibber jabber on these fair internets about the newest contender for the portable headphone crown  the sennheiser px
i bought a pair of those senns and lived with them for a couple of months  they are acceptable for a set of portable cans i guess but tend to get very congested and cluttered in the midrange
theyre also bland and cold
beyond sound theyre not even as comfortable as the portapros as they require constant adjustment to stay on top of your head while youre walking around
finally the senns are not only less durable than the portapros but the warranty is only two years vs  kosss incredible no questions asked lifetime warranty
thats right you never have to buy a set of headphones again until you die
just incredible
if you want to demo this sound t a lower price try out the koss ksc  ear clip model but be warned theyre nowhere near as comfortable
buy with confidencethese are by far the best sounding portable headphone ive ever heard
they are very efficient and play louder than most small headphones of this type
the sound on the low end defies their small size and they have plenty of great sound at the top too
as far as style goes ive heard a lot of people complain that they are out of date looking
im not quite sure what the problem is
just about any headphones of this type are going to be a band with two round speakers not much you can do in the way of style
if you would prefer the band to go behind your head you can try the sportapro
for the money these are hard to beat
the sound is so good they make a good choice for everyday listening as well as activities where portability is neededgreat sound time proven stats and abilities
check out reviews elsewhere i did these are the best quality for the pricei listen to rock stones bruce led zep doobies kate bush eurythmics etc
and tons of classical  lots of beethoven but also choral rutter and paumlrt and baroque handel and bach and especially piano concertos
i discovered jazz about two years ago and listen to much bill evans and miles and tord gustavsen
i own grado  headphones nad cd player and a nice yamahapowered music setup with paradigm speakers
whats my favorite listening experience
my iphone with these koss portapros
on my second pair now and always keep a spare pair in the study in case i ever lose these portapros
bass is fantastic and mids perfect
i would boost the treble a bit to match the purity of my grados but nothing can touch the bangforbuck experience of these koss phones
greatest experience for rock music
im loving them more every day
not just great portable headphones  they are amazing headphones period
buy nowbest sounding open ear headphones ive ever heard
ive used them almost every day for a long time
bass is very powerful for something that doesnt enclose the ear
sound is very clear and they can also handle a lot of power
as others have said the headband can rip out a few hairs occasionally but that is the only complaint i havethese are great headphones for the money
i wish the cord was a little longer as i use them at my desk
the sound is far better than ive found with others in this price range so its a reasonable tradeoff for me
the lifetime guarantee doesnt hurt eitherin comparing the koss portapro with the sennheiser  which is a good deal cheaper and also quite a bit bulkier ive concluded that both headphones are amazing for the price but theyre quite different
the portapro has significantly more bass
i had to keep the volume at about  what i keep it at for the sennheiser
the portapro is perfect if youre really into bass if youre really into the beat
the sennheiser is better for purity of sound
i just feel that in general it gives a truer purer sound
the sound that the original artist had in hisher head
a lot of people will love the beat on this
but some people will find it overpowering
im listening to something by the beatles right now and im pretty sure george didnt want pauls bass to dominate so muchor maybe this is the best way to put it you know how when you go into the movie theater and the previews start playing youre struck by how great the surround sound is
its so rich and bassy you can practically feel your bones vibrate
thats what the koss portapro is like
its great for watching movies
but it just doesnt give the purest vocal sound for music
if you want to turn up the volume to focus on the vocals the bass will deafen youthe sound went out in one side after  months
the headphones lay on the shelf for a year because i never got around to mailing it in for warranty theyll replace it for you but it isnt free
and then i decided to fix it myself so i got a new plug from radioshack and got down and dirty with wires for an hour
after  minutes i was cursing myself for choosing to do this myself
but finally i got it to work
and to keep it that way im not going to use it on the move
i recommend getting a cheap pair of earbuds for when youre moving around the sony mdr j is my favorite  it stays on and it has lasted me longer than any other brand and keeping these relatively more expensive headphones for use at home
as you move around the wire bends in your pocket and eventually the connection is severedoh and i agree with other reviewers that these headphones do get painful after a while
but i kind of think thats a good thingit limits your headphone use and will probably save your hearing in the longrun
and you do have to learn how to take them off without them pulling out your hairyears ago i was introduced to a st of koss studio pros
they were actually a fullsize headphone which looked very similar to these
they were lightweight very comfortable and had the most amazing clarity
it seems to me that koss has simply miniaturized the very same koss headphones i had years ago
they are lightweight very comfortable and retain the same clarity of the larger phones i used to have
these are excellent for listening to acoustic music as well as rock
the highs are crisp and clean and bass is fat and full but not overwhelming like the dres
one of the things that i noticed more so than other headphones ive own is the separation of sound
you can distinguish the left and right channel clearly
it totally adds to the listening experience
my only complaint is as far as i know koss has discontinued the fullsize version of this headphone which i used to have
i would like to see it on the market again but until then i am very pleased with thesei use to own these same headphones back in the s and they are still dynamic
i would recommend these headphones to anyonethese audiophile headphones have no business being less than 
well they kind of dothey sound great and have audio design by john bruss
the sound imaging is pretty amazing and they respond beautifully in their frequency range at all volumes
i wear them for  hrs per day at work and theyre not as fatiguing as earbuds
the look is very s so you def wont have to worry about people stealing your surprisingly awesome headphones
the headband can grab your hair if you pull them on over your head so make sure to pull them open before putting them onthey saved money on the industrial design but spared no expense on the audio qualitydo you wanna look like a jogger from 
do you want your music to sound fantastic at the same time
these are your headphones
seriously they sound excellentthey are a little overated do sound muddy depends on the track you listen to but highs never sound like they shouldi wouldnt say there bassey but more of a swamped out muffledyou could do better if you look around but there not bad but if you own these they cant be you only pairif you love the bass in the music this is your headphones
this is a real killer with high expression of basses high quality sound good noiseblocking comfy but you probably will feel uncomfort in an hour it causes sweating and heating in ears after some time lightweighted and in contrast to style arguments of other reviews pretty stylish with its blue color and metal connectioni strongly recommend the product
especially given its pricei bought these koss proporta headphones after getting tired of the small inear headphones
ive had a bunch of them including bose and bang  olufsen
these are better than any of those
i was just looking for something to use with my computer at work
i dont use them a lot but am now finding myself using them a lot more than i used tofor what i wanted these for and for the price not sure how you can beat them
ive also had the highend bose noise canceling headphones but they are so big and bulky that i just dont carry them with me when i travel
several of the reviews commented on how hard it was to get these into the leatherlike storage bag that comes with them
i did not find it a problem at all
they fold up and hook together and easily fit inside the bag
they are super comfortable my hair is short so the hair pulling isnt an issue
the way theyre built theyll probably last forever or at least until i get tired of themi wouldnt hesitate a moment to buy these
hey if you dont like them youre only out about 
im not a sound expert so they sound pretty darned good to me and much better than all the small ones ive been usingha widths years agodesign looks a bit lighter than back then but has added fit switch tight or loose which is niceas ever great sonice and the price i got it for 
was a stealgreat choice for comfortable home use and moderately active outdoor performancei was seeking new headphones to replace my ipod nano headphones which are pathetic
i had some koss earbud headphones that i loved but lost so i needed new ones
so i came on here to find reviews of other headphones and saw that the reviews for the portapro were great
since i had a great experience with koss in the past they replaced my earbuds on my old phones for free no questions asked i decided to try these
the reviews are rightonid describe the sound of these phones as if two of the best speakers youve ever heard were on both sides of your head
the sound is great at all volumes
the clarity is such that i can hear parts of songs that i never heard before
the lows mids and highs are perfect
some headphones sound bad at high volumes and the sound gets muddy and the bass sort of shakes in your ear
well you dont get that with these
its like youre in the studio recording with the band
you can tell the difference between a kbps kbps and a kbps mp file with these headphones
the only thing i dont like about them is that i can hear outside noise like cars whizzing by a good thing i guess or the engine on the bus
this can be kept to a minimum by turning the volume upthe headphones look big because of the headrests they have but  they are ergonomic
i was playing a video game while listening to these phones at forgot they were on because i didnt feel them on my head
they have three comfort settings light medium and firm
they also come with a little case which is nice
the phones fold up to the size of a baseball and both speakers fold inward
a small clip exists on the bottom of each phone which attaches both sides together when you fold them
you then wrap the cord up and go
they can fit into a typical pocket
these are portable headphones and i dont know why people say otherwisethey are some of the best headphones ive ever heard
no surprise koss makes them
they are also manufactured in the usa so there is no outsourcing of jobs with these phones
i can understand why these phones have been on the market since the s
theyre fantasticbeing a headphone freak since i was first turned on to them in  viet nam
i find these to be a good pair to use with my portable cd player while working at my pc
i have numerous and sundry headphone from high end sennheiser to junky chepos that i purchased because of my headphone fetish
i even own a couple of the vaunted sound canceling phonei have always liked koss products especially my old pro aas
these porta pros have a warm sound and as i like my music loud sometimes and soft and low sounds other time they are perfect for me
i would give them a hearty thumbs upthese are awesome headphones
i work in a crowded load office and there are days that would be almost unbearable without these headphones
i am able to crank up the volume and the sound quality is excelent
the bass produced from such a small package is remarkablei did have to replace one set of the cushions after a few years and eventualy one of the speaker wires started to short out
koss stood behind their lifetime warrenty and replaced the unitthe first pair of headphones i bought in the s were from koss and my experiences with their lifetime warrenty has made me a lifetime customermost cheap headphones claim they can reproduce bass down to  hz but these are the only ones that even come close to matching that claim
the clarity and durability of these headphones is also amazingi adore these headphones
im really hard on them and use the things almost daily
they get shoved into my bag ripped out tossed around and stuff like that
other than the time i stepped on one of the plastic sides and snapped it but superglue fixed everything
theyre just the same as when i got them last year
i tried using the blue tabs to adjust how tight they are but didnt have any success
bass and sound quality is superb
whenever mine break im getting another pairi have owned a pair of koss portapros back when they first came out and could not believe the sound from these headphones
i have tried other brands but have never had as good of a frequency response that these headphones can produce
i will never buy any other pair of over the ear headphones as long as they keep these in production
they are that goodi own  each of grado sr  sennheiser rs  and both the koss sportapros and portapros
the sound you get with the portapro is as rich to me as the grado sr   its amazing that such a light headphone can produce the same rich highs and deep lows
accuracy is no problem for the portapros since there is not much materialbetween the portapros and sportapros i think the portas sound better the sportapro has developed a light distortion with bass the reason i recently purchased the portapro
the sportas metal band does not slip as much as the porta but the porta oneups again with an adjustable comfort zone setting for the temporal pads
designwise i like the more masculine look of the portas over the sportas and never used the behindtheear configuration of the sportasi bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews id read on the internet
i wanted something with decent sound and comfort that wouldnt break the bank i will be traveling abroad for a semester and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo
i wasnt sure what to expect as im not much of an audiophile but i was very pleased with the portapros
they are very comfortable provide ample bass and overall sound quality and fold up to make them quite portable to boot go figure
the included case and  audio adapter were nice bonuses
i am using them with an ipod and my laptop both sound even better than my stereo with the portapros
only thing i dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in travel mode doesnt hold all that wellif you buy them consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with koss portable replacement cushions
the headphones will last but the pads might eventually tear they did on my old sony headphonesas a drummer i normally opt for bigger headsets that are enclosed especially for playing electronic drums the problem is that they dont let your head  ears breathe making it uncomfortable to wear for long sessionsi bought these with the intention of using them for my mp player but i thought why not give them a try with the vdrum kit
wow
these cans really pump the frequency range was something i totally did not expect especially when monitoring a live electronic music instrument  drums no less
these headphones handled the pounding drum sounds perfectly and with no fatigue at all
i was able to also hear other live instruments as well
the only drawback is the level at which these headphones start to distort out now this is a level which i believe is way beyond normal listening levels  remember this is from a band rehearsal at full volume
so during a solo practice session these did a phenominal job
however it is a lot to ask these headphone to be the primary monitor cans during a full blown gig  the sound pressure levels are too muchbut if youre looking for great headphones that are comfortable to where for long periods and sound fantastic then these are the onesi highly recommend themsweet cheap glorious sounding phones
get a volume control also koss and you are all set
cord is a bit short but plugged into the volume control you will have plenty of length
these are really excellent sounding phones
i couldnt believe the difference between a couple of other cheap ones i have
highly recommendedthese have been highly regarded for many years and i recall having had a pair maybe  years ago
also you may want to buy some replacement foam pads
i use mine outside and they get a lot of sweat on them
changing pads is a breezethese are the best pair of headphones ive ever used
i only had to buy this pair because i somehow broke my last pair had for over  years
the breaking was all my fault nobody should expect a pair of headphones to survive being run over by a car
mea culpa
seriously though the audio is the best ive ever heard from nonnoise canceling headphones
i use these on walks and jogs so i need something that doesnt completely drown out ambient noise
they do drown out softer noises much more than earbuds so be carefulokso here goes another comparison between the koss portpros and the sennheiser s
i am not going to bore youboth headphones are outstanding performers with an ipodi own them bothso which one is my preference
the sennheisers for one reason onlypeople use their ipods in malls and on the go
there are times when i want to remove the phones from my ears for a few moments say in a store or when having conversationwith the sennheisers i can remove the phones from my ears and let them hang around my neck in comforttry this with the kosss and they will place a stranglehold on you
for this reason alone i recommend the senns
bothin my humble opinion sound equally goodi need to say it up front these are the ugliest headphones ever
with that out of the way i can heap mounds of praise upon themsound is paramount of course and these are no exception
i sort of prefer the sound of these to some of the closedeard headphones which i think sound like a cave sometimes
they almost sound good as the sennheiser  not as good of course but still impressively close given their pricethey are exceptionally comfortable
at the risk of sounding corny they feel like wearing airthey can folded up to very small dimensions a nice pluswhile youre shopping just remember this factkoss portaprorockin out nonstop since  because of overwhelming customer demandtheres one solid fact about the performance of portable headphones and thats it
go with the proofi bought these headphones a few years ago after reading all the glowing reviews on amazon and im so glad i did
im pretty rough with my headphones and these things can take a beating
i ended up replacing a pair after  years which is unbelievable in itself because i usually go through a pair of headphones every six months
and it wasnt because they didnt work its just because the wire near the jack was exposed and getting frayed
here are all the prosvalue  they are a great value for the money
ive had more expensive headphones that didnt sound as good
even if you dont want to spend thirtysomething dollars for headphones and dont care what they sound like i still think it would be worth it because you wont have to replace them every six months when something breaks on them
these headphones are very durable and arent made of flimsy plastic like less expensive ones are so in the long run they would be worth itcomfort  these are very comfortable
there are  settings tight and loose to adjust for different head sizes
ive never had a problem with the ear pads wearing out or anything digging into my ears or whatnot
these fit very comfortably on my head i have a big head btw and ive never had a problem with them sliding offportability  these arent the smallest earphones in the world but certainly not the biggest
they do fold up if you need to pack them and they come with a little pouch to put them in
i bring them along on trips on all the time and ive never had a problem with themsound quality  they sound fantastic
better than a lot of more expensive headphones
though any headphone with the koss name sounds great i think these are the best
just the right amount of bass and treble
doesnt sound tinny or like youre playing music in a tunnel
if youre used to less expensive headphones youre going to hear stuff in your music you never heard beforeease of use  well most headphones arent hard to use and these are the same
the only drawbacks to these is i found it hard to adjust to loosetight setting on the sides and they are sort of of a pain to fold up which is why i never fold them up
ive owned foldable headphones that were much worse thoughbuild  awesome
the headband is metal and the casing for the earphones are hard plastic and very durable
not long ago i accidently broke off one of the earpieces
guess what it pops right back in
five stars for buildive never buy another pair of headphones ever
i bought  pairs of these one for home one for the gym and one to replace the ones from home and i plan to buy more in the future if need be
i love love love these headphonesthe only slight con i can think of is they arent sleek looking like other headphones in fact they look like they came straight out of   i dont really care what they look like though and quality of these headphones more than make up for the uglinessim hard on headphones
i use them at work all day long and they get a work out
ive gone through  sets less than a year and a half
when these arrived i groaned
they appeared much flimsier than i expected
well more than six months later these phones are going strong
sound is good quality is good
there ya go
these have been around forever
i think im figuring out whythey look old school but these things are awesome
i bought the replacement pads too but havent had to use them yet
the sound quality is amazing and you dont lose anything like you sometimes do with noise canceling headphonesyou notice more sounds with these headphones
this is one example of traditional electronics that will never be beat especially at this pricesure these headphones look a bit wierd
a matter of taste at besthowever the sound is great
whether the source is a smartphone tablet or pc this is an excellent sounding headphone for the pricei felt inclined to write a review because i was so impressed by these headphones i had tried a bunch in the process looking for headphones in the  range tried bose oe  sony xb  pioneer home theater a  sony v  out of the more expensive headphones i thought the bose oe sounded the best very clean crisp highs and great bass and very comfortablethe only headphones that came close to the bose oe in terms of sound were these koss portapros and they cost th the price
some people were saying the new design of the cable meant that they are using cheaper materials or something
totally untrue the headphones feel and look great are comfortable enough for a good couple hours and sound amazingeven if you plan to buy some expensive headphones i really think you should have a pair of these i actually just ordered a  pair of denon d but i dont regret the portapros one bit they are awesome great bass good mids and highs albeit not as good as the bose but close enough considering the drastic price differenceupdate after  month use recently i purchased some denon d and beyer dynamic t both retail over  i still cant believe how good the koss stand up to them
for fun i tried connecting the koss to my nuforce udac hp ampdac and they sound even better mind you the denons and beyers have more clarity but once again considering the cost of the koss its worth purchasing for portable use even if you have expensive hifi headphones
still impressedive been listening to these for years and years
for the price they are simply amazing
great bass response
crystal clear highs
wonderful for all kinds of music pop rock jazz classical soundtracks
i actively go out and listen to the competition all the time
i did just order the sennheister px s because evidently they edge past the koss headphones
i find this hard to believe but well see
i do love the bose qs and plan to get those for home and travel
but when it comes to serious street bopping for the koss
you will not be sorry
promisei remember seeing these in kmart way back in college
hard to imagine that theyre still making them or that theyre really still that good
perhaps the latter is the reason for the former
you can spend a couple hours online reading one review after another after  googleing best bang for the buck headphones under  yeh i did that
or you can just take  seconds and click add to cart and get them delivered to your door in a day or so
really youre not going to be sorry
really
no reallyive tried to give koss praise for these all over the internet where ever i canthese headphone just do not get enough creditthey are small hold well on your head and sound fantasticgranted if you want full on studio get big  to  dollar over the ear headphones but for a reasonable second place when you are jogging at the gym these are the ticketive bought about  or  pairs and plan to buy these for the rest of my life unless i hear something betterthat hasnt happened in a decade so farthe best
try them outafter hearing the crisp full sound of my cousins koss portapro headphones i had to buy a pair of my own especially after the fact that my awesome old skullcandy headphones failed after   years of serviceawesome they arrived  days earlier than originally projected so i open the box to find a shiny new pair of koss portapros
i had about  minutes to sample the awesomeness before i had to go to work so i fold them up neat design by the wayand fit them into the tight as in physical not fashionable carrying pouch and set them on my dresserthe next day i have more time to actually use these guys so i pull them out of the pouch
this is where i need to warn buyers before getting these headphonesthe pouch is too tight when you pull the headphones out no matter how careful you do it one or both of the earpieces will snap where it swivels
update never mind the warranty is amazingfor the price there is simply no other set of headphones that will provide as warm and beautiful a soundspace
its that simplethis is my second pair of portapro phones and my third pair of headphones using these drivers
they may just be the best headphones ive ever owned theyre not perfect but they have proven sturdy they travel well and they sound great
no kidding the only headphones ive used that sounded better were the expensive bose noisecancelling sort so i consider this money well spentdrawbacks a little pricey
i bought the first pair for under  on a competing site so you might do better with another vendor
the steel band can be a little uncomfortable but hasnt been for mebottom line these are a great buy and i look forward to using them for a long long long timei have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with cnet before i purchased anything
i am so glad that i got these they are so very comfortable even with brand new ear piercings and sound incredible
i am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warrantymy daughter didnt have a nice pair of headphones and we looked these up on amazon and cnet loved them so for christmas i bought them for her
she loves them how often can you really feel the music
well now that is possible with the porta pro from koss
just got mine and they are incredible
amazing is too short to describe the experience
highly recommendedi have had these headphones for  years and the headphones are great
but more than that koss is amazing
if there is a short a problem and there have been about  over the years they give you a lifetime warranty on the headphones and have either fixed or replaced them for a nominal charge to cover shipping and handling
i recommend any koss headphones not just because the sound is really good but because they stand behind their productive had these wonderful phones for three months
i use them for my ipod classic
the sound is rich and full
strong bass with no distortion even at high levels
listening to fleetwood macs dreams makes the song sound like a dream
you can hear stevie make sighs and sounds you dont hear on the cheap ipod earbudsand when you listen to led zeppelins moby dick it feels like youre sitting right next to john bonham as he pounds on the drumsits unbelievable how good these phones are
when you listen to the counting crows acoustic version of amiee with its mandolin intro playing in the left ear and rich acoustic guitar coming through on the right ear you will have an eargasm baby
it is an experiencethe portapros are also hands down the most comfortable headset ive ever worn
you can adjust them to fit tighter or more loosely around the ears and the extra padding really helps with the comforti should say that these are not noise cancelling or sound isolating
i cant wear them in bed at night because even with the volume rd up on the ipod my wife can hear them
same thing with riding the train or bus
you wont want to wear them in public partly because they look like something worn on the set of the  flick tron and partly because your neighbors wont want to listen to your musicbut if you care about excellent quality sound and you are not disturbing anyone these are the best sounding headphones you can buy under 
they are a big step up from the soso ipod earbuds and a bigger step up from anything walmart sellsi should say that these sound better on mp players than they do on hifi equipment
i definitely prefer my beloved grado srs for listening with my stereo or with my laptopbut the portapros are a steal at i almost forgot to mention that there is a lifetime warranty on the portapros
if they accidently break and you still have your receipt koss replaces them for free
awesomei have bose acoustic noise cancelling headphones which i paid  while this koss headphones i paid   black friday deal 
i can say i love this headphone way more than bose
 recommendedi bought this item after going through so much research
i was interested in this because it is in cnets top  and so many good reviews in amazon
so i dont think one more elaborated review is not necessary but i want to focus on some issues specificallycomfort i bought a sony mdrxb for its extreme comfort and good sound quality after i buying koss portapro thinking that koss is pressing my ears too hard because my ears were paining after listening for couple of hours
afterwards i noticed that pain is not because of the pressing alone but because of the high bass from koss
if you listen at little less volume it shouldnt be a problemmechanical issues there are glides on the headphone for light and firm wear but when i put them in light mode they just dont stay there
they come to firm position once i touch the phones
one more thing unless you pull the metal bands to the end they try to collapse
this is not an annoying problem for me because i have a big head
slowly my ears are used to this and i can listen for longer times and i am listening at low sound levels
so i changed my decision to return these and i am keeping themjust to list the pros and cons i experiencedpros best sound quality light weight portable extra bass you love itcons design not up to the mark mechanical issues like glides not staying in their position
extra bass you can hurt your earssuits my needs almost perfectly
a great balance of quality construction design price and sound
all that and a life time warranty from a company with a solid reputation
i love these headphonesim a live sound engineer
i have many pairs of headphones
i love these for personal listening with mp players phones portable digital audio devices
great for travel
ive purchased several of these
they sound way better than youd thinknot being familiar with the koss brand i was hesitant to order these headphones but with all of the consumer reviews being four stars and higher i decided to buy a pair
they are small what you would expect from a cheap portable set
however the sound blows me away
i hear every little nuance of the music
the bass is very present the highs are crisp and clear
well done koss
they are comfortable to wear easy to get a good fit with minimal adjustments
they do seem fragile only time will tell
get a pair hear for yourself
im quite surprised and very happy with mineive worn out two pair of these phones in the last decade
the sound quality was great
wonderful bassthe only phones with  better have been phones that fully cover my earsand arent really quotportablequot these stayed comfortable for the excruciatingly long flights from socal to northern norway even while wearing glasses
they fold up nice and small easy to tuck away
they also performed adequately while watching airline movies  more than saved the price of the phones over several tripsi have two complaints  hair easily penetrates the quotspeaker grillquot and makes irritating noise against the actual speaker membrane
 the speaker while reproducing sound well can develop tears in the membrane easily
be careful
nothing is more annoying than a buzzing speaker at  feet well perhaps sudden cabin depressurization my second pair wore out about the same time as my vintage walkman
i replaced the setup with a nomad ii mg amp a pair of noise cancelling headphonesthey make a huge differencefive stars for sound quality
five stars for comfort
five stars for portability
five stars for durability
if youre not going to spring for noise cancellation and you need a folding pair of phones then get a pair of portaprosi own  pairs of headphones and several more have been and goneby far the portapros are my favourite for portable music
long walks with the dogs bike riding train travel plane travelthe sound these little babies pump out belies their size
truly excellent acoustics for such a small packagenot many companies these days offer a lifetime guarantee
says a lot about this productsome people are unsure of the retro look
i for one love it
theyre unique in that regard but at the end of the day its all about the sound and thats where these headphones exceldo yourself a favour and get somei know there are a million great reviews for these phones
im speaking directly to longevity nowi got koss portapro phones ages ago i think i got mine in  seriously i bought them specifically for listening to ftp begotten mp files before i found napsterthese were the best phones i ever found for these three reasons they arent monitors so i can hear humans in my vicinity calling my name
ear goggles would not allow that when my kids are sleeping and i need to hear any cries in the night this is critical
also i could use them at work they provide excellent response range and i assessed this in my s when i could still hear over mhz and now i swear to you fourteen years later im listening to the same phones and still loving the sound quality
ive had to replace the pads ive long since lost the case but these are the phones hanging atop my computer monitor for when i want good sound quality with my netflix streaming
the metal has not even a blemish fwiw i have not had to replace the temple pads
for some reason those have not deteriorated
i dont get it logically they shouldveanyway whenever my kids break these i will buy another pair with unreserved exuberanceaside koss also oems some of the headphones for radio shack
i had a much less favorable experience with those phones
you should stick with the brandname version
apparently even the koss factory is capable of producing crap for an oem jobid been looking for some comfortable affordable headphones that provide great sound and came across the reviews for these koss portapro headphones
the reviews do not liethese are absolutely perfect for my purposesi use these with my mp and pmp players as well as my blackberry curve if im listening to music on it and have found the sound to be phenomenal
now im no audiophile but these definitely give me more detail than previous headphones ive owned so im very happy with them
they are also extremely comfortablei needed some overthehead phones because ive always found earbuds and overtheear phones to be painful after awhile i wear glasses which are a definite factor
these have been very comfortable on my ears and i can wear them for hours
i have not had the hair catching issue that some people mention so ive been lucky with that as welldefinitely worth the price and if they ever break down i know koss will provide me with a new pair
i know they may look a little strange but ive never had people comment on that  they just want to know if they are good and what kind they arethe only con is i wish the wire to connect to my devices was a little longer  not a lot but just a few inches to provide a little extra give
however most headphone wires are wayyy too long so this is a very minor conthese are not noisecancelling phones and they were not purchased for use on planes i have some foam ear buds i use for that purpose so i cant comment on how they would work in that situation  i think too much noise would definitely get through
so just use these in everyday situations walks in cars when others are driving etc
where it is actually a good thing to hear some of what is going on around you for safety purposesall in all i am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these headphones to anyonei bought a pair for my family computer  years ago
aside from replacing the ear pads once in the  years  they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use
the independent reviews speak for themselves
allow me to put it this way koss does not make many models of headphoneshave been pulled out of bankruptcy in the s because of these headphones and have not changed the design since their introduction in  with that said these headphones keep the company profitable  so let that be a testament of how good they are
furthermore companies do not change their designs if they struck gold  look at the german car makers and american muscle
they have not changed have the same accents and characteristics because you dont fix things that are not brokensound qualityi bought akg qs and they were horrible for the price
i had to sell those nightmares off to buy these
it served me right for considering anything but koss
after hearing such bad headphones i missed the pps because i am currently away
i needed these to remind me of home
these sound very well balanced have great bass and crisp mids and lighter treble
i think that bass heads will not like these but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones
they do let inout sound as they are padded and open air but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable
the open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy
these are also very warm headphones with a presence of midspros great sound and lifetime warrantycons they are a little awkward because of the metal band but you will get over it when you hear how good they areif you are buying online and dont have the time to test them
just buy these
its a no brainer
these are the most liked and most reviewed headphones for a reason
if reviews dont convince you  i dont know what willive been saying for years that these are the best headphones you can buy for under 
that might not be correct though you may have to go up to  to find cans as good as these
for the price they simply cannot be beat
they are light supercomfortable and they sound great
the only downside to these headphones is that if you fold them up and wrap the cord around frequently the cord will break
its not even a matter of if its a matter of when
ive gone through  or so pairs of these things
theyre cheap though so it doesnt bother mei love these they are the best head phones on the market in my opinion
great sound cheap lifetime warrantyas an example i sometimes use these when i edit movies while others usually wear these really big and expensive ones from sennheiser or sony
one day some guy came over and almost laughed at me for using such small head phones so i let him give it a try and he was really impressedthe sound is nice and crispy plays low mid and high tones equally well
i listen to black and death metal and these work really well for thatyou really cant beat the sound of the headphones for the price
they fit really well sound amazing look sweet and rival higher end headphones
i am going to pick up a set for work and home
even though they are portable i still forget themi own several pairs of headphones and earbuds ranging in price from  to over 
ive had a pair of these koss portapro headphones for several months now and used them on pcs for games and on an iphone and an ipad for games music and video
these headhones have great sound with all the devices
i like them so well that i just ordered  more pair
it would be hard to beat them for the pricei purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed
they do not have the best high range but decent
great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style
they performed so well that my  year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his
when i called him out on the retro style he shrugged and said have you heard these  enough saidcomfortable sturdy  decent sound
i certainly would buy other koss products  i recd this one for those of us who cant wear those uncomfortable ear budsi am very pleased with these headphones
they produce great sound are light weight and adjustable and fold to a very compact sizemy only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack which is very rarely found instead of an adapter for two prong jacks which are required for using these headphones on an airplane
i couldnt even find an adapter at radio shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only
oh well otherwise theyre greatoutstanding bass while keeping everything else clean at an incredible low price and confortable i have had koss headphones in the past pro aa and qz
the koss portapro is portable and has great bass response
the work great with my android phone and can be rolled up to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched
they are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day
the sound is night and day better than any earbud could be and are almost as good as the pro aa
they are open air headphones so you cannot match the bass to the sealed types but it comes close
for  you cannot go wrongsound great for the price and size
very portable very sturdy and very cheap
 star worthy on that alonelots of bass not the best bass but it is fun to listen too sometimes
the low end is definitely exaggerated but not like other reviews would have you believemids are good a little lifeless but very god to listen too on the go
accuratish and they arent over emphasizedthe highs ehn
well again they arent great but they really do sound nice if that makes sense
they arent perfect and at times sound a little slow but these arent  can either they can be had for  if you know when to buyvalue   nothing in this price range competesbuild quality  very well built but not indestructiblesound overall  there are better portable phonessound value   overall rating i cant give  stars so i give it on a side note my pair werent like the picture more like the best buy pair in one of the buyers note picturesi had a pair of sennheiser headphones that had about a  dollar price tag that broke
these were around  dollars and are comparable set of headphones if your looking to save a little money
granted i think the sennheiser were a little better but you cannot beat these at this price point
they defiantly pickup on the lower range bass sounds quite well
where i think these headphones slightly lack is the midrange and some fine detail that you get on a nice set of headphones but thats expected at this pricethese are a bit awkward to put on at first but i assume you get used to that
from the moment you have them on listen to music and think you are using a  pair of headphones
the sound quality is simply outstanding and outright unbelievable that anyone could produce something like this and sell it for this price
i just got mine and simply felt compelled to get off my bum and write a review  they are that good
they do leak a bit of sound so i would refrain from using them to listen to hard rock in a funeral the look may also be a bit of a giveaway but other than that  they are simply unbelievable
highly recommended
as far as the comparison to the px  my wife has those these were a replacement for my pair that i gave someone as a present and the sound quality of the koss is far betterso i was in the market for a great pair of phones
was looking at some grados but they are pricey
so when i found these i was a bit surprised at the specs to cost ratio
must say the look and feel great and the sound quality is just fantastic
would definitely recommendabsolutely amazing sound quality for the price
at first they may sound a bit bassheavy compared to other headphones but once you get used to it it sounds great
powerful and full sound
i find them super comfortable on the firm setting but i have a narrow head i think
the additional foam pads on the temple really help the comfort level
they fold up fairly small but its hard to fit them in the leather bag provided
i wish they came with a hard case for true protection while travelinga great product which i would definitely buy againmy very first set of headphones purchased in  were a set of koss pro aa
they were heavy rugged and sounded great when plugged into my kenwood receiver
thirtysix years later the aas still sound great but are not at all portablethe earbuds that came with my ipod sound allright but lack bass response
i tried a set of sony ex earbuds
better bass but uncomfortableafter much research i decided to give the portapros a listen
actually i would have loved to have found a retailer who carried the portapros so i could listen to them before purchasing but having no luck at the local big box retailers i decided to purchase the head phones via the internet and audition them at homeno dissapointment
these are a quality set of cans
great sound great price and a lifetime warranty as wellthese are comfortable and deliver great sound and the cost is reasonable
i also own the sennheiser px which also sound great and are comfortable but cost twice as much
the sennheisers fold down a bit smaller but its not a big difference
the koss portapro is definitely a good quality product
good reviews from the audio experts toofirst of all unless you have a huge fetish for retro s looking headphones these headphones will not be pretty
they were created in the s and because they got such a great response the company hasnt changed anything about them  including the design
however there is no doubt whatsoever that the sound quality that comes out of these is absolutely amazing
for the price that youre paying about  bucks these things are  worth the money
they appear a little flimsy but its pretty incredible the sound you get when you plug these things in
they also come with a larger plug for other equipment that requires it which was really convenient for me since i got to use them for my keyboard which requires a  stereo plug instead of a 
furthermore theyre really not that fragile
i accidentally got my set jammed in my desk and popped off one of the side headphones but it just snapped right back in and i havent had any problems
they also have a lifetime warranty in case anything does happen to them which is always a plus
definitely a great investmentbought my set back in  still working as i type this
the only thing to buy with it is koss portable replacement cushions and ftaurum cables mm male to mm female stereo audio extension cable on amazon alsodefinitely one of the best sounding headphones under 
well worth the money
just that it might pinch your hairno longer use wired headphones as i have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones
i couldnt deal with the messy wires
they worked well but they are in the pile of stuff for my local church to selleveryone is surprised by the awesome sound when i have them listen to these
i use them regularly at the office as well as when i travel
they collapse well for traveli didnt know much about this brand called koss
i just simply bought this since they looked very portable lightweight cool and contain some bass
apparently this headphone almost sounds as good as my  dollar beats by bull hdfor a price of  and the incredibly small size this headphone is simply amazing
bass is reasonable enough though some house music metal or dubstep can make the bass sound all mixedup and rather disgusting than clear however if you want some clear bass you might wanna look at headphones around  or even higher 
other than that i didnt find any part of its sound quality less than i expected
besides i didnt even expect any bass to be in this tiny headphonei use this whenever i am doing some exercise and so far i find no need to buy another earphone or a lightweightonear headphonegreat job koss i just simply love this
xdthis is one of those musthave headphones that you can use as a reference to compare other headphones with
its the best in its class and beats many other headphones that are way more expensivethis headphone require some breakingin period at least  hours otherwise you may find the bass to be overpowering and fatiguing as i did at first
i put the headphone in continuous play through an amplifier for over  hrs nonstop at medhigh volume
now they sound better less fatiguing and more laid back as the audio geeks would sayif you want more portability try the cheaper koss ksc
they are clipons but sound almost the same as the portapros
i said almost because the portapros are punchier and have more defined bassi searched a long time for a set of portable headphones
i had a set of in ear bugs and although they were great my ears would hurt after wearing them
the koss phones are very portable and have amazing sound for the price
many people said that the bass was to much but i found that for the music i listened to it was very rich and supportive to the rest of the music
one problem is that when they retract or pull apart your hair can get caught in them
these are also not noise cancelling phones so that you will hear a lot of external sound
for me i wear them sometimes when driving so that works perfect for me
i would recommend them as being really a good buy for the price if you are looking for a portable non noise cancelling headphoneuse it all the time on the subway
its been used for over  years
just becareful of rolling up the cord
after a while it could lose some of its connectivity at the head socket if youre too rough with it but luckily it has a lifetime warrantyi have had a pair of koss portapro headphone since they came out about  years ago
they are the best
i believe they were once toprated by cu
they have wonderfull bass clear sound are comforable to wear
they are low priced
they have a lifetime warrenty for  sh repair or replacement by koss
how may other headphones have this
you will be very happy with the portaprosimply the best inexpensive headphone on the market
hard to believe they first appeared  years ago and they still cant be beatout of the box these sounded a little odd but after letting them burn in over night the sound is very smooth
the bass was ok i thought until a really heavy bass note hit and these things showed a little more power and much deeper bass
the build could of been better but for a pair of on ear headphones i wasnt expecting the heaviest build these are about just as durable as most sets of on ear
however these come with a life time warrenty
these do start to hurt my ears eventually i keep the comfort setting to light so i can get more hours out of these in comfort
i can say i have a set over over ear headphones which sound better then these but also cost  times as much
for walking around on the go these are great they sound good light weight but dorky looking
none the less i am a college nerd so i guess it works out for meunbeliveable until you hear them quality for the priceim a musician but not much of an audiophile tho id wager my hearing is slightly above average
the amount of richness esp base was surprising  i couldnt believe my laptop usually very subpar sound and rio karma as compared to the sennheiser mx earbuds could output such quality tones
my brother recommended these he has perfect pitch and much better ears than me as he uses these during his commute instead of his grado sr s which were getting beat up and arent nearly as comfortable as the koss portapros
though obviously not anywhere as elite as grados or beyers i find it impressive that these are an adequate replacement for his grados
additionally the tension adjustment is a really nice feature and the cushioning arrangement works great for people who wear glasses
additionally they look really snazzy with the metallic blue accentsi keep hearing about this little headphone that i just had to try it
when the opprtunity came up for me to purchase a small headphone i jumped on itthere are countless reviews here describing about portapro
so i will skip most of things mentioned here
i will just focus on my experience with itfirst of all koss was not a known brand for me
only time i really saw their product was when i went to thrifty now rite aid and saw their cheap earphones in their electronic section
naturally i always thought they just make cheap quality products
in last year or so i started looking for a budget price headphone with good sound quality
and this product kept popping up in reviews and peoples recommendations
i was intrigued by the fact that this product is essentially unchanged since its launch in the mid sfor  price range headphone i am not so sure if there are better headphones
it sounds just amazing
very full and rich low and mid sound not muddled but clear and balanced
highs are not as strong but it is very well balanced with the rest of the sound rangebuild quality is just average
i dont mean its badly assembled or anything like that
but even by mid s standard parts used are extremely minimalistic
some people commented on the metal adjustable band constantly shifting and not locking in its position
basically it is not designed to lock into one position
if you take your headphone off you will have to readjust the length of the metal bandanother bad thing is that you just look silly wearing this thing
but i think once you hear the sound quality you wont mind wearing itagain for the price i dont think you can beat it
update  i love this headphonethis is the second pair of koss porta pros i have purchased wire started shorting out after a few years of repeatedly dropping my ipod
sound quality is great for the price
they are comfortable to wear
what more can you expectbetter sound than i expected for the price i paid
they collapse easily take up little space and i dont have to shove them in my ears which is nicei bought a pair of these a few years ago based on their popularity and stellar reviews and i wasnt disappointed
i bought a second pair to keep handy in my basement with my home theater system for when its late and i dont want to wake up my wife while watching a loud movie
these are very comfortable to wear as opposed to earbuds which i cant stand and are generally weak on sound and i havent owned or used a pair of headphones that sound as good as these including some  closedear models
the sound is clear with the right balance of bass and treble
a lot of headphones do not have enough bass or if they do the overall sound is muffled
these find the right balance and sound great for music or movies
and at this price i doubt you could beat iti have recently realized that i am what some like to refer as an audiophile
ive always loved good sound reproduction excellent sound range as well as quality
when i was younger i used to buy koss pretty much exclusively
lately though ive been somewhat disappointed though with a few exceptions the koss portapro being at the top of the listthese headphones have been around since i was a teenager and unlike me they are still going strong
they have fantastic sound they are not overly affected in the bass range they dont add extra bass for the boom boom window rattlers out there they are economical comfortable and just all around a fantastic buy
also they are recommended by serious audiophiles as the best portable out therei cant agree with that entirely i also recommend the sennheiser px and px depending on your needs
but of the three these are the least expensive but offer fantastic sound that you would expect to come out of a pair of full size cans headphones i guess im learning the audiophile lingo
the koss portapro have the comfort zone temple pads that help make them even more comfortable and the pressure between temple and ear can be adjusted literally by the flick of a switch on ear side of your head
i have a massive head and these fit me with room to spare
i like the firmest setting on the comfort zone but ive tried the other two settings as well and i can honestly say that there is a difference it is not just a gimmick
the comfort zone really worksthese are truly portable also
they fold up into a little ball that can then be placed into a convenient case that koss provides
i personally would recommend buying a semihard shell case that koss also sells just for the extra protectionwhat more can i say
if youd like a few other recommendations in the truly portable range the sennheiser px and px are rugged comfortable and highly portable
they collapse as well and fit into their own plastic case
if you like earbuds the sennheiser mx is wonderful with its inline volume control the sound is absolutely amazing for something so small
and finally the koss ktxpro is an excellent portable headphone with an inline volume control
it uses a titanium element to drive it
all of these are great products but ultimately this particular review is about the koss portapro and i really am blown away at how great these tiny portable cans truly are
i believe you will be toothough ive become somewhat disillusioned by koss as ive become a socalled audiophile why not just call me someone who really loves good sound to come through good instead of creating a term that sets me apart from everyone else
 i highly recommend these cans to you
if you are on a budget you especially cant go wrong
remember that koss guarantees all their cans for life with their no questions asked guarantee
its worth it
so as my review title states the koss portapro shines in every area
oh one last thing  dont listen to people who say these cans are ugly or clunky they arent
the design is what gives the portapro its unique sound quality and i personally think they look cool
ultimately though it is the sound that matters righti have both the koss protapro and sennheiser px headphones
i love them both
i just bought the portapros brand new
my px is  years old and the mechanicals are wearing out
heres a comparison between the twothe mechanicals on the px are a notch better than the portapros
the px has headband padding the portapros do not and take a few hairs out now and then
once placed on your head both are comfortable
the px folds up neater than the portapros
the px design is sleeker more modern and less prominent on your head
the over all construction seems a notch better on the px
heres the interesting thing though
both are open air but the portapros seem to seal out external sounds a little better than the px
i cannot explain why
the portapros are also slightly more efficient and play a bit louderthe sound character of each is a matter of taste
both headphones sound excellent
both are sweet clean and very detailed
both are nonfatiguing
the protapros are a bit bass heavy
on some music that bassy sound is magnificent
on other types of music with already prominent bass the px is preferable
surprisingly the high frequencies are equally well extended on both headphones
the portapros are a little sweeter in the high frequencies than the px
the px may be a little more accurate with a slightly better midrange than the portaprosthe px is an uptodate modern design
the portapros are classics with a design that goes back  years
the original px came with a nice case
the portapros have a hook and eyelet at the bottom of the metal headband
they hook together to bind them tight to fit inside a small bag
i use neither the bag nor the case
you may want to buy both
you cant go wrong with eitherive owned a pair of porta pros since   i have used the koss lifetime warranty several times in that period and every time its been just fine
on one pair i had even soldered on my own replacement plug and i called koss to make sure they would still be covered
the man on the phone said you could chop them up into a million pieces and mail the pieces to us in a bag and wed still send you a replacement set
now thats customer servicesound quality  you will not find anything in this price range that even comes close
the bass is deeper than you would expect for such a small device and the highs are clear
the sound is not fatiguing at all
i listen to them at the office every day for up to  hours and they are brilliantcomfort  since they are openear design they dont make your head sweat
the metal band can snag your hair occasionally but its not a major problemlooks s tastic
i think thats a plus your mileage may varyvalue for money unbeatablesee title
both my wife and i love these they fit nice very nice price look reasonably durable and the sound range is everything i can hear
whats not to likeim a headphone nut ive invested thousands in highend headphones dacs and dedicated amplifiers and i consider myself to be pretty picky
you can trust that i would give a negative review if it was warrantedfor the money you would be hard pressed to find any headphone that sounds better
good bass without being overstated highs are clear with good extension and midrange isnt harsh my biggest complaint with headphones under the  mark
these have a similar sound signature to my beloved sennheiser pxs not the substandard px ii twos that have replaced that discontinued model at a similar price pointfor anyone looking for good quality sound on a budget you cant beat these trust me ive tried them alldont expect much in the way of isolation blocking outside noise from coming in or keeping your sounds from coming out with these and the sound quality is much more apparent in quiet environmentsthese dont really need an amplifier for normal listening but i do find that they require a little more power than my zune will put out if im on an airplane or trainid buy these again if lost or stolenthis is my favorite headset to use around the house
pros light weight collapsible adjustable band good sound comfortable to wear
i get tired of using my inear phones
it is not noise isolating but i like being able to hear my surroundingsi have owned a lot of low to mid range headphones in my lifetime
currently i have a pair of skullcandy earbuds a pair of the stock ipod earbuds and a pair of  sony studio headphones the big overtheear onesthey were not working for me
the sound on the sony ones were pretty decent but prolonged use made my ears ache and could get very warm in the wrong climate likesummer
they were also very heavy so reading text books or just reading my kindle these things would not cut it as it would also put strain on my neck
my ears were just not made for earbuds as i had various problems with those
the ipod earbuds failed miserably as the sound was always too shallow for me and they kept falling out of my earsso i looked for the most rated headphones not earbuds with over a  star rating on amazon and stumbled across these
over a  reviews and it still had   stars
yeah ill take some time to check these out lolso i got them a week ago
to avoid any premature reviewing i let them sit the first three days with music on constantly racking up about  hours of break in time before i tried them out objectivelyfirst the headphones themselves
they are very very light
the head band are a couple of thin metal bands with plastic pieces that adjust size
i like this because metal is durable but its also light and airy and doesnt make me feel like im wearing a music factory on my headthe ear pads are more comfortable than i imagined
they are not dollar store ear pads although they look that way and are comfortable on the earsa wildly awesome thing about these phones that people often overlook are all the parts that make them comfortable
the ear pieces themselves are hinged so they bend depending on the shape of your ear
the metal bands are firm but flexible so it doesnt press too hard on the head or ears
then theres comfortzone settings
it took a minute to figure out how the settings work but once i did i was treated to a unique comfort experience
comfortzone consists of two pads on either side that rest on the temples
the firmer the settings the more pressure on your temples and less on your ears
i found this awesome as i could sit with these headphones on my head for  straight hours and feel no ear fatigue at allnow for the part everyone wants to read the sound
i am not an audiophile and i wont use any technical terms
the music sounded just plain great
i can hear bass lines in rock songs hiphop and rap songs thump but not uncomfortably so
the music sounds whole and complete and not shallow and airy like ipod headphones do
the high notes sound good and even at high volumes dont cackle or distort and in no song that i listened to did anything sound muddy or wrong
the volume is well balanced
maxed out is too loud and thats something my other pairs of headphones cant say
ive often had to max out settings just to get a decent volume on my sony headphones
these i can keep in the middle volume range and it still sounds goodtheyre not noise cancelling and they leak sound
im okay with this because when i jog id like to hear the cars coming before they hit me  so if youre looking for noise cancelling and quiet for others then you should probably keep searchingall in all for the price i cant imagine having gotten a better pair of headphones
personally i love the retro style of the headphones
keep in mind that chucks have fallen in and out of style for  years and theyre top sellers
this has been in and out of style for nearly  years and its a top seller
i put them in the same category and as it happens own both now which is totally awesome
if youre looking for some lightweight phones that sound great and have a unique look then your search is over
i wish id found these  years ago when i started using headphones for the first timemy first portapros came with a koss fm radio i bought in the mids
they never wore out outlasting the radio by more than a decade and i eventually misplaced them
i was thrilled to discover theyre still available after all these years
theyre comfortable and durable and they sound great
lifetime warranty too
very few products these days avoid obsolescence for a quarter century
the koss portapros are tried and true and still relevant
imagine thatawesome little headphones some of the best sounding set i have ever owned
theyre a little rough to look at but i am very glad i gave them a try
these sound terrific and adjust for your ears with lighter pressure if you so desire
the only drawback i would see for these has to do with their higher impedance at  ohms as opposed to a lower impedance for most portables out there
the higher impedance means that batteries would empty quicker when used with mobile gear but well worth the money for the sound
amazing product i will buy a second pair as a backupi shopped alot before i decided on these headphones i read all the reviews here as well as on many other sites
to tell you the truth i found the hype hard to believe for a product that has remained unchanged since the s 
i rated these babies a  star for the sound quality and price it helps if you have a headphone amp if your using small devices to run them like  ipod but not mandatory they get pretty loud without my amp and probably would protect your hearing better without it
i can tell and improvement with the amp but it sounds really good just plugged straight into the ipod 
i really like these over my vmoda bass earplugs for certain activities like exercise the bass buds sound better on alot of things without the amp especially but if you walk or ride with the buds in your hear the wire rubbing your clothes it amps up your breathing etc
plus if your walking like i do where people bike or drive you cant hear them coming up behind you  not a problem with the porta pros on
i have to point out that you can hear them if your sitting or standing next to someone wearing them so if your listening to somethiing loud and dont want to disturb others around you they dont work well for that like on a plane bus in a car so there are some limitations to it
people made alot of issue with the retro style either for or against
in all honesty they really dont look all that odd on your head and are quite comfy the fact that they fold up to carry in the bag is nice but they are still bulkier than a pair of ear buds
alot of people reviewd them as being studio quality monitor headphones this to me seems a bit much but they are definately on par with any headphones i tried while looking for a new seti even felt they rivaled the bose over ear set although the noise cancelation you get from the cup does make the bose sound better on some stuff
i would say you cant go wrong with this headphone set especially for small devices like ipods and the likethe build quality seems cheap and all but the sound quality is pretty good
the little pouch that came with it seems nicepunchlinei have looked around and cant think of any overtheear headphones with a  price point which would sound better than koss portaprosfyi there is a newer model which has a remote on its cable and supports ios devicesi remember drooling over these way back in the day when one of my favorite european hifi magazines used to use these as a reference for all portable headphones
they deserved it
and although the crown had been taken off these by better headphones as the time went by portapros have still lot to offer and easily beat other competitors twice the price of these or more
i would not hesitate for a second to put portapros above dr dres beats which are an over priced mediocre sounding phenomenon these daysdesignportapros draw attention of onlookers as their signature design does look somewhat nerdy
 fit is great the temporal pads can adjust their pressure hence alleviating the pressure put on your ears the bridge is selfadjusting consisting of two pieces sliding on top of each other though the plastic sleeves on top of the bridge can push into the top of your head and if you have less hair you may feel it after awhile
also if you have long hair or lots of it not my problem your hair could get snagged between the bridge pieces and get pulledcable is oxygenfree has a  degree angled mm jack and splits to go into each side of the headphones
it is not replaceable so if it breaks you need new cans
koss honors limited lifetime warranty if you registersoundthey sound as good as my akg q maybe with a touch more bottom end and a bit more of treble
due to their construction they do not isolate outside noise as well so using listening to your tunes on the train or in the city with lots of ambient noise will make you crank the volume up
beware their bass is powerful so treat your ear drums with some carelistening to portpros at home or during a stroll in a park or quiet neighborhood is a joytreble mids and bass are in a great balance so these cans do not require much tinkering with eq
i actually use the flat equalizer setting on my ipodimpedance is  ohm so you need to turn up the volume a notch or two when switching from a pair of standard  ohm headphones to make portapros sound at the same level of loudnessi bought them at kmart which was closing and they had them marked for i will eventually buy the pack of replacement foam ear padsincluded is a nice little faux leather pouch and can fold and fit into it very nicely so good news for road warriorswith all of the hype related to these headphones i was expecting to be let down in some way at the very least
however after many months of use at the office ive come to believe that these headphones are really something special
its hard to imagine getting such a full sound out of such an inexpensivelightweight product
they are easily driven by an ipod or smartphone but they really shine when plugged into my laptopswith beats audio and without
solid but tight bass rich mids and shiny highs help these headphones breathe new life into the songs that youve been listening to for years
do yourself a favor and stop thinking about it and just get yourself a pair
you wont regret iti had a pair of these best buy edition with clothcovered cable  updated styling not anniversary years ago
those were misplaced but i remembered them fondly
i switched to bluetooth behindtheneck models for awhile motorola overear and those were great but i forgot how much soundquality was sacrificed by the switch
had to buy new ones after my motorolas were stolen so i came back to the cord a little reluctantly since i use them activelyglad i went back
the clarity is fantastic
comfortwise i do have to toggle the firmness down to light every time i put them on and thats somewhat annoying but the convenience of rolling them up eclipses that
the cord is on the shorter end at four feet which i appreciate ive never seen the need for long cords on headphones
if i need to use them at a desktop or something ill grab an extender
the pouch is gimmicky and a touch small but serves the purpose ill probably put them in something else
the headband can catch longer hair but i wear a buzz so thats not a problem
theyre even more comfortable than similar models while laying down to sleep
some people complain about the style but ive always loved it
theyre easier to wear underneath a knit hat or in conjunction with sunglasses
the design is eternal for a reasonyou really cant do better at sub
if your hair is longer wrap electrical tape around the band it wont collapse anymore but you wont rip your hair out
if the stock pads dont satisfy get some grado bowl replacements but the stock pads are fine
if they break send them into koss for a replacement  sh
 the new model has an angled plug not rightangle but not straight either which i find convenient for preventing cablebreakage but might not work with some casesa testament to how good these headphones are my very picky grandfather has gone through several different models of headphones
after he tried my new set on once i had to order another pair the next dayhands down the best sounding headphones i have ever purchasedthey really should be broken in for optimum sound though hook them up to an audio source and let it play through them for about  hours
after breaking in they will sound amazingive read quite a few reviews about how some  pair of headphones sounds just as goodbetter and i can tell you that its crap
some people cant tell the difference between bass and quality
if all you want it bass with no fidelity youll be sadly mistaken but if you want bright clear sound with a good range and great clarity these are awesome for the moneylooking for portable headphones i first went with thesennheiser  px  lightweight collapsible headphones because ive been using sennheisers for years the hd s for about  years before they finally died and thesennheiser  cxb inear  stereo headphone old versionfor the couple of years they lasted and figured id try their portable headphones
as i wrote in my review of the pxs httpwwwamazoncomreviewrifumdqjrwrefcmcrrdpperm i found them uncomfortable and lacking in bass
these portapros fix both those problems i can wear them for many hours consecutively before my ear cartilage gets a bit sore but this is a big improvement over the sennheiser px s which started hurting after only about an hour
bass is good enough though perhaps lacking slightly compared to highend headphones
but for  these offer a great bangforbuck in sound qualitythe only negatives are the retro look if that bothers you  i dont mind it at all and if you have long hair i dont the metal band tends to catch your hair and pull out a few strands i know when this starts happening to me its time for a haircut we have two pair for now over a year and they are well made and easy to store away in a purseive had the koss portapros for about four months now and i decided it was time to give them the review they deservedi mainly used standard sony studio monitor headphones for personal music listening when im on my desktop computer or laptop and i would use earbuds with my ipod on the go or in bed at night
i decided i wanted to try these headphones considering the golden reviews theyve been gettingwhen i received them they were a lot smaller than i thought they would be but they fit my head perfectly and they are very comfortable
i cant even feel them after a while
they do require a little adjusting after some time but my ears dont feel sore after long listening sessionsthey sound great and they look great too
some people might think they look too wildretrogeeky but thats what i like about them  they are unique in their design
they dont look bad to me at allthey have an extremely clean and crystal clear sound
the highs are crisp the mids are warm full and natural and the lows are tight deep and fullsounding
they do have a little bit of extra bass but thats no problem for me
i can just turn off the eq on my computer audio player and they sound perfect
i always have the eq off on my ipod so they sound just fine there too
the extra bass really isnt that bad at all
it shouldnt affect your buying choice with these headphonesyes they are flimsy and you have to be somewhat gentle with them but they are surprisingly durable
ive fallen asleep at night with these headphones on and when i wake up finding them near my pillow off my head im worried they had been destroyed
to my surprise i find no bends or any signs of stress on them
the ear pieces dont even fall off either and those are held on with just a little plastic clip it looks like
they pivot to fit the shape and position of your ears
the only cons i have about these headphones is the somewhat short cable length
its ft
long but i sometimes find myself accidently yanking on them with my arms when im not careful
thats fine though as i just use another ft
extension cable i found
i also have to adjust the headband to almost its widest when i put them on
i wish there was some type of locking mechanism on the headbandthese have become my standard headphones for athome and onthego listening
overall these are great headphones and i will definitely choose these for the rest of my life or until they stop making themthis koss model received overall very good reviews
i can understand why they sound full open  and music sounds great
also comfortable although i have not worn them for an extended time
i would recommend  if one uses them hooked up to a cell phone make sure the mike is relatively close to your mouth
others may have a difficult time hearing you
very pleasei have this for  years now and i still use it for my everyday use
it is strong and sounds great better than a lot of my more expensive headphones
too bad people care more about aesthetics then the actual quality if things anymorebought four sets of these phones for  apiece on the amazon website
this price is  of the msrp
i have owned portapros for nearly  years
just recently i had the chance to compare them with super high end phones costing  and 
both were over the ear models
while these pricey phones delivered superb sound  the difference from the koss phones in my opinion did not justify spending  to  times as much money
more importantly  the over the ear models proved extremely uncomfortable in my case producing jaw pain after a relatively short period on my head and so severe  that i had to reach for the bottle of motrin
by contrast the koss phones with adjustable ear pressure are supremely comfortable
i can wear them for hours without any problems
finally koss stands by their lifetime guarantee no questions asked even if you mistakenly sit on them
in summary  you absolutely will love this headphone
even the stereophile gurus acknowledge the incredible priceperformance ratio of this stellar product
unconditionally recommendedits true when im on the go these are what i take with methey leak sound but what does it matter when youre smashin a dj setbestow these on your head and you might look like something from tronso work it because these have a very clear sound
the bass isnt amped but you dont want it to be if youre producing musicfor what it is plus the lifetime warranty  for shipping  ive suggest these to many a personps
 its been over a year of heavy use and even losing them once in a moshpit only to later find them sweaty but unharmedthese things can take a hit and the bass is still better than i thought it would bei had mine sent back and i think it was  dollars like a year ago  shipping
and i felt like i got a brand new one back in the mail
they even replaced the cushionsthe sound quality of this headphone is very very good
lets just say that it has its own stylei can say for sure that  highs are clear and the base is on the heavy side and it has just enough surround sound
but the sound quality of these headphones are so unique that you just have to try them out for yourselfif you are an audiophile you got to have one of these just because its worth having iti was a long time loyalist to the sennheiser px  headphones
i went through two pairs in a few years but was absolutely bummed when i heard that they were no longer producing them
instead they improved on the design but i didnt want to spend the extra money and the reviews werent as promising as the original modelsinstead i looked around and settled on the portapros
the sound is awesome the storage is very good not as great as the pxs they are very durable the cord length is perfect and the  throwback design is just a bonus
once i wear down my current pair that im using right now i will definitely have to buy anotherthe koss portapro headphones work for me as earbuds dont stay in place
i use them while on the treadmill and they stay in place and provide good sound quality
so far i havent experienced any problems i have had them over a monthi purchased these headphones for a recent overseas trip
i used these headphones on the flight to and back from europe and they proved to be excellent for both music as well as movies
if you can live with the design these headphones are hard to beat for a reasonable pricei was skeptical that these would provide such a good sound but they really do sound as good or better than high end headphonesporta pros have been around for decades in various models and theres a reason theyve been so successful
its because they sound so good
ive had several versions of these since the late s and never been disappointed
get some youll be glad you didthis is an excellent product for the money
first time i tried them on it was unbelieveable how well they sounded
even the low end is pretty good for such a lightweight headphonepreviously i had a set of altec lansing uhp headphones which i paid well over 
they sounded very good but after less than a year of use a short developed in the cable and one side kept cutting out
i returned to altec lansing and never heard anything from them
no more altec lansing
these koss headphones at less than half the price and equal sound quality and with a lifetime limited warranty can not be beat
had them for over a year and still sound great
the sensitivity is also excellent which means i do not have to turn up the volume as much as with some of the cheaper headphonesa quick note about koss i had a set of pro aaa i think headphones that i bought in the early s
i started having problems with them
i wrote a letter to koss and sent it with the headphones to them and in a few weeks i had my headphones back repaired and working perfectly
and this was around   still have the headphones even bought an upgrade version of themgood company good producti have owned these for two years now and use them almost every day
they are light comfortable and easy to carry in my bag
i have recommended them to several family members who are also delighted with them
the sound quality if very good for the price and in fact better than some that cost two or three times as much  as i have discovered to my regret
i highly recommend thesei just got these in the mail today
i wanted something cheap with decent quality
the sound quality from these headphones is amazing
i cant attest to the durability of them since i just got them but wow the sound is crystal clear with great highs and lows and no distortion
they are kind of dorky looking thoughit is absurd that these are so cheap
they sound basically as good as pro studio headphones
totally effortless full range of sound that is completely clear
and since they are open you can still hear things around you so you dont walk around with that sensorydeprived living in a cloud disconnected from the world feelingalso theyre totally comfortable
cannot go wrong with thesevery good headphones especially for the cost
the sound is not really accurate its more muddled in the mids and lows
but for some reason this just makes them sound awesome like some vintage amp playing an old school record
i definitely recommend thesei cant improve on whats already been said about these phones
sound as good as my grado sr at about half the size and cost
seem to be very well constructed but ive only had them a few daysstayed in place on my head through a sweaty mile jog this morning
first time ive had my tunes along on a jog and i highly recommend iti run on a busy highway so i wanted to be able to hear outside noises for safety
i could hear the traffic and the music
with no outside noise the music is just incredible
i use kbps mp mostly and although i have a pretty good pc stereo setup maudio kenwood bose i heard not only new musical nuances but words which i had not previously recognizedi dont pretend to be an audiophile and my hearing has gone downhill but ive been into music a long time
were into sacd dvdaudio with klipsch and polk speakers so i think ive heard some pretty good music
i was still impressed with the clarity and fidelity of these little phones
oh ive tried them with both my pc stereo setup and through a sansa clip player
both sound terrificthey dont look as hip as the little buds but they dont look totally dork either
cable is plenty long enough for me
now i did hear a slight click with each jogging step which i think is just the wire slapping the phones or movement of the ear cup itself
it may begin to bother me and if so ill try to eliminate it but today it just helped me maintain a steady pace and didnt detract from the music at alli think most people will really like these phones
i definitely doi needed a set of headphones that was small enough to take with me wherever i go
these deliver surprisingly punchy trebels and mids
the bass could be stronger but is not at all shabby for other headphones in this price range
love the retro look
the foldability makes them ideal for my laptop bag and workout bagthese headphones are not only great for listening to music
but i bought them for playing electric guitar piano and violin thru them for prartice
the extra ohm  makes the diff over the  ohm ones on the market
i didnt want the big bulky studio ones that feel like you are wearing football helmet after a hour
these are feather lite and really cant even tell they are on your head
you line  pod users or other multi effect users well lover these
the extra ohm does make a diff in tone
no ice picking or high shrill
rich bass and tone through out
very pleased with them
as well as the tone for mps
very rich tone all the way around
at  ohm you wont notice that much of a diff for mps
but for playing musical instruments thru them the extra ohm makes a big diff in tonewell be using these with my line  pocketpod and guitar on the shady back porch all summer long
they are not like my marshall stack but they excellenti know my neighbors well love emthese are great sounding headphones 
they are little hard sometimes to resize for your head but the sound is stellar for the price years
 years and counting
this is how long since the koss portapro was introduced and to this day they still roll off the production line virtually unchanged since  talk about market endurance and lasting appeal
this headphone model trudged through and survived the ever evolving portable music industry from the cassette walkman to the era of mp players and the ipod and now the streaming era
its baffling to imagine how one seemingly unassuming product could accomplish such a featone probable cause is the quality to price ratio
the portapros have gone up in price over the years but still currently at  they still remain a great value in headphones because of their unrivaled sound quality at this price point
koss for the most part is known more for their budget headphones but the portapro is one audiophile secret that the masses need to know about
these pump out sound so decent they compare well enough against headphones way beyond  their price range
in fact i like their sound signature so much that i use them as my starting reference headphones to analyze other sets
they are the ultimate beginner audiophile headphonesso what is it about these cans that make them so great
why are they revered by fans all over sparking a rather vocal cult followingseeing them for the first time you might not even dare venture to try them on
they look like light flimsy cheap s headsets
which is in a sense what they really are
some may even argue vainly that they are so ugly and hideous it will be horrifying to be caught dead with them hugging your noggin
 i find them charmingly futuristic in a retro kind of way though
like how scifi movies in the s imagine what future thingies will look like
theres a minimalist nofrills commitment to these headphones presentation
see theres just this mere sliding metal headband on top attached to plastic mounts that support two thin even more plastic grilled sound drivers thinly wired with black foam padding terminating into a  mm  degree jack
but that same plastic mount gives the portapros their unique iconic look and character
its called the comfortzone slider and together with the metal accents it lends the portapros that robocopterminator aesthetic
it was probably a gimmick back in the day because the comfortzone settings light to firm hardly do anything for me except point the drivers outward on the light setting resting the foams on my temples
the portapros therefore are known and remembered for this look and koss was smart not to tinker with something that is iconic
and you dont get the portapros for their ruggedness or luxurious build quality
they feel so utilitarian they could be the headphones communists will finally distribute to the proletariat
they feel so delicate and fragile that koss was kind enough to give a lifetime warranty
so basically if you buy a portapro now you are set for lifeat the end of the day you get the portapros because of their sound characteristics
these would never have achieved their legendary status if not for their aural properties
this is why we obsess over headphones anyway
they are not a flash in the pan fad nor are they glossed over by celebrity marketing
these are honest and straightforward consumer products endorsed by the same consumers themselveswhat you get with the portapros is surprising clarity and detail you cant believe a budget headphone is actually piping it out
the drivers on these things are awesome for their price and size but they are not perfect of coursethe high end detailing sparkles with this set although treble is somewhat grainy
bass is substantial and not overpowering but however could get loose in the higher bass frequencies
this low end bleeds to the the lower mids rendering it with a slight nasality
the proper mid frequencies are forward and present but they lack smoothness
technically with these faults you could argue that these shouldnt sound good but all in all when you combine these traits its actually a pleasurable listening experiencei think coupled with their specific sound signature what makes these portable sets shine is their soundstage and separation
since they are technically open back sets the soundstage is unconstrained by resonance giving them this feathery airy feel
instrument separation as a consequence is remarkably even and it fleshes detail out
of course there a lot of expensive high end sets that could do this better but if you are upgrading from entry level sets near the portapros price point then the sound difference will be life changing
like i said these could rival or outperform headphones twice or triple their price
some people compare the portapros to another open back can the grado prestige series sri stereo headphone or thegrado prestige series sri padded headphones but nothing could be more different
these grados are excellent and extremely detailed but they skew more towards the bright treble side of things which could sometimes be too harsh for some people
the portapros are tuned more as balanced sets if not bass focused what with their slightly forward mids
both these grados and the portapros are brilliant entrylevel sets  although the sri are twice as expensive
i use the portapros appropriately enough  more for s synth pop rock and new wave while i prefer the grados for acoustic guitar recordings and  if you must do get bothso in summary the iconic portapros are a th century wonder for their longevity and enduring appeal
their price to sound quality and their minimalist utilitarianism is probably the main reason why they have such a following
if you dig that retro chic look and you want a quick entry to quality sound without breaking the bank then get yourself the portapros nowok i went on a headphone buying spree so im comparing these portapros to headphones that cost many times as much sennheiser hd headphones that cost a bit more sennheiser px and my old sony headphones
well my sonys are history
i never realized how smeary they wereno detailthese koss portapros hold up very well in comparison with any of the phones i mentioned
good detail and the frequency balance is excellent far preferable to the pxs and even comparable to the expensive phones
very pleasant to listen to
if i had never heard those expensive phones i would be happy to have these koss portapros as my only phoneswhat ive learned by comparative listening is what people refer to as soundstage
with the koss phones everything sounds like it is at your ear or between your ears
not unpleasant and you wont know what youre missing until you hear it for yourself but the expensive audiophile phones give you a sonic perspective that extends beyond your earsfar more realistic
i know that considering the price differential this may be an unfair comparison but i just had to point out that you do sometimes get what you paid forso the bottom line is i am in love with the sound of my expensive hd headphones and at the same time i am very happy to have these koss portapros for portable use
as a bonus the portapros are even more comfortable than the expensive phones
and unlike some folks i wouldnt say they are ugly at alljust differentthe koss portapro has a great retro design because they havent changed the darn things since they were introduced in the s
the reason being that they got it right the first time
the sound quality is great for open design headphones theyre easily adjustable both the headband and the firmness with which the ears grab the head very light and can be worn for hours at a time without having any issuesthey fold down into a relatively convenient size and even come with a travel bag
if mine get damaged i will buy another pairafter reading most customer reviews and a few technical reviews on portable headphones the two names with the most positive comments were koss portapro and sennheiser px i bought both pairs to do my own comparisons after  week i submitted a review giving the portapros a definite edge although not a dramatic one after a full month of listening i no longer use the pxs i hear things on the portapros you dont even notice on the s i would like to amend my original opinion to say the portapros are significantly better and provide a lifetime warranty starsfor my th review i thought id sing the praises of one of the most useful and wonderful things ive ever owned the portapro
i got these shortly after they came out as i always longed for bass in my early aiwa walkman best of breed back then
these thangs changed my lifei still love music deeply but back in school it was everything to me my solace and balm and ecstatic release hours and hours every day
i still wear mine daily while running the dog walking the dog and during various nondog activities as well
they have tremendously balanced sound lots of bass but very open and tight bass not sloppy
the highs are clean and never harsh the mids smooth and present
from bach to the beatles to metallica to charlie parker they deliver musical sound in a pleasingly full sound spectrum top to bottomfor the money they are a miracle
they turn any mp player into a real sound machine and blow away any of the inear phones except for the thousand dollar customs go to the headroom online if you want perfect soundthey sell these alongside the best cans in the world say no more
they deliver a surprisingly real soundstage and plenty of truly musical detailadd to that two great features
they fold up easily and fit in your pocket make sure to get the folding ones worth the extra few bucks for sure making them a perfect companion to tiny mp players they are a perfect match with my muvo gb player such sound from such tiny devices
but the best feature of the portapros is the inestimable lifetime guarantee
and they aint whistlin dixie folks they mean it
i would know as ive bought maybe four of these in the last  years but ive owned about  new pairs total
whenever the cords wear out or pull out of the ear can happen its only thin rubber and wire happens now and then when youre mountain climbing etc i send them back to koss with a sixdollar check only gone up one buck in  years and in a week i get a brand new pair
if that aint taking care of the customer what isso for coming through on their promises and for making a truly greatsounding and very cheapforthequality headphone i give koss total props and praise for this product one of the best values ive ever encountered as a music uberlover
this and a muvo gb player will set you back only a hundred bucks and then give you so much musical pleasure everywhere you go
i have enjoyed my portapros on mountain tops inside the louvre prado moma etc by the sea on ski slopes on trains in the high alps with views to die for as beethovens sixth took me to heaven in the subways and busses of dozens of lands in front of literally thousands of sunsets from big sur hills to jamaican beaches to mallorcan cliffs to norwegian fjords and so on for twentyplus yearsi can only imagine how gratifying it must be for the spirits of the great composers to know that their music can now be heard in good sound anyplace on the planet
if weve achieved one useful thing as a species in the last thirty years this is it great portable sound that turns any post office line etc from a nightmare into a dreamin fact now that i think of it no product ive ever purchased has brought me this many hours of joy except perhaps some of my guitars
the pros were  bucks in the mids and are now only  with inflation it should be far more
thank you koss for proving that some companies still know what value is
this is a bargain of the highest degree
whoever invented these i love youbuy some for a friend i have many many times
and make sure to buy some for yourself your life will become a lot sweeter especially if you know how to let music take you far beyond this mortal coilmy highest recommendationread a few of the below reviews and you will get the picture these are the best portable headphones for ipod use hands down
they sound incredible and are best for working outwalking with an ipod
nothing compares
not the ipod ear buds not  isolation headphones that go in your ear i wasted big time and money on themnothing
if you only buy two headphones in your lifetime but these for your ipod and a pair of grado srss for home ipodstereo use
you will be happy you didi am not an audiophile by any means but the portapro headphones are exceptional
the sound is especially in lieu of the minimal cost of the unit clear with a more than adequate amount of bass
as a bonus the comfort level when wearing these headphones is wonderful
bottom linea funky looking set of headphones that deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience
try themyoull like themive had these for a few months now and im very satisfied
great sound quality very comfortable and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market
so  stars from mei listened to several nonearbud headphones from  and these are the best between them
while i havent listened to headphones over  i believe it would sound better than many of those too possibly the best ever
good clarity with good bassvery good construction too
can adjust to a lighter setting for more comfortonly  minor issue
if the earpads arent centered on your ear or if you have big ears then sometimes the edges of the pad can press uncomfortably on your ear only felt if you leave them on a while
probably koss should offer a larger size keeping the speaker the same though or make the original pads at the edges outer radius slightly concave away from the earbest bucks ive ever spend on a portable headphone glad i didnt go with bose ae this sounds just as good just as comfortable and th of the cost heck best money ive ever spend on a headphonealso love the openear design i can finally hear people talking with me at work now i was on the verge of buying bose headphones but the price bothered me
i read at least  reviews from different sources and decided to buy koss plus my picky sister said they were good
im pleased they sound great and the price is rightworks great if youre not planning on getting sweaty sounds fine for the money compared to the price of the xtrememac  class of earheadsets on the marketi dont know how someone could give these anything below three stars
sure i could understand four but two stars
these things are amazing
the only two cons i would have are that  they could be more portable the earpieces dont rotate so when you compress everything down to its most portable size its still more of a sphere than a circle
 yes i know that openbacked speakers are known for better sound but ive had people sitting next to me be able to identify the song im listening to because these things leak out so much sound
the main problem with this other than embarrassing yourself or annoying the person next to you is that they dont work very well for plane riding or anything where its loud it was extremely difficult to hear many of the low notes in songs while on the plane last week
other than those two things these things are great
speaking of folding flat earpieces one of my buddies used to have those similar sennheisers i probably spelled that wrong and he used to lend them to me for a long time until i got these but the spot where the wire went into the earpiece actually frayed to the point that that earpiece went dead
so overall i recommend these to anyone who just wants a cheap yet very high quality pair of cans but check out the grado srii they may be a little bit less portable but theyre that much more amazingi own two pairs of these headphones and gave my son a rd pair for christmas
great sound lightweight enough to go jogging with or wear around the house while doing chores
unlike earbuds they stay in place
they are not indestructible if you accidentally step on them you will break them
but they do hold up just fine with normal wear and tearhighly recommendedfinally found them on sale for 
the sound is great
there is an emphasis on base but thats ok im using this set with my flac player when i want music to wake me up and get me excited
im very happy with the purchase
if however youre looking for the perfect balance of sound and frequencies spend more money
for the average listener who just wants to get pumped this is the set to buy
besides if youre listening to an ipod or any mp why would you want to spend more on a headset
there is only so much improvement that can be made considering the supression of the sound coming out of the deviceive had a history with koss and they provide such amazing sound qualitytwo tips take care of them or they will get destroyed
try to keep them in your room or they will get destroyedi had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and i must say theyre still working great
excellent audiophilequality headphones for a decent price
so far theyve held up incredibly well over the year or so ive had them
theyre very light and they havent fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all but still glad to have the koss warranty to replace them if i need to
the carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that but they will fit with a bit of finagling
i am a  year old college student so im on the go a lot
i keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in
if i decide i want to be a tool and wear them around my neck theyre nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace
i also love getting looks from people
some comments includei like your headphones
those are some wacky ass headphones man
those are nice how much did they cost
they sound amazing
et ceteraprosi personally love the s stylingfold really small and are very portable
duhcome with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from methe ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that i was expecting theyre actually closer to tempurpedic mattress foam but a bit less squishythey used to automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them
ill explain belowof course the best thing they sound greatconsthey fold small but not flat
the headphones are still as thick when folded as the diameter of the ear pieces and such
i really wish they folded flat that would make these truly greatthey dont feel all that well made
but have held up thus farover the course of the year or so ive had them the metal headband part has bent slightly but i imagine its from the times ive tried to fold them up too small so be aware of that ill explain belowthey will make your ears ache after a while an hour or somehi dont like how small the carrying case is if it wasnt so well made id think i was going to rip the seams or something when putting my phones away
actually its not the case itself thats too small as i can fit my mp player in the bag as well but the opening
it doesnt open very wide
be careful not to snag anything when putting them awayprice is pretty cheap but not exceptional but i cant complainthey dont noise cancel but theyre not noise cancelling headphones
i put this here because its both good and bad
i like hearing my music in peace but i also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear
so theyre okay for thatthey have a comfort setting on the sides its a switch you have to work
no it is not an electronic switch for bass boost or anything like that so dont get all excited
its a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter
if you have it on the light setting and you movefold the phones inward though itll automatically jump to the firm setting i think
its kinda gimmicky but it does adjust the tension slightly
this will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long periodso as you can see my cons and such are mostly about certain bonus features of the headphones
as a pair of headphones theyre the best ive ever hadokay so as i wrote above there are two things i have to elaborate onself adjustment when i first bought these headphones i could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology
neat
well its been a while and while i do my best to take care of my technology all the foldingunfolding of them due to the nature of the design has bent the headband slightly out of the almostperfect circle it used to be in
it does not look any different aesthetically but it inhibits the little selfadjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally
and by little selfadjusting magical fairy gnomes i mean those black things on the metal headband that guide it through
anyhow not a huge deal as its still very easy to adjustfolding the headphones as ive said above the constant foldingunfolding of the headphones will if youre not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing bend the metal headband to the point where it wont selfadjust as easily as it originally did
so im going to help you figure out how to fold them so you can avoid bending your pair on accident
okay so its pretty easy to do
the large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward
fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears
they will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the ovalshaped head cushions
now on each side of the hinge area there is a loop and a hook
i dont remember which side is which but youll see it
its the end of the metal headband
hook the ends into the ends and youll have a nice neat circle
now you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself but do not go too tight
this is how you will bend them
i would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in
now you should be good to go and theyll stay nice and foldedanyhow thats about all i have to say
these are well worth the money
i dont use them at home because i have larger more comfy headphones for that but if im out
this is all i use
i generally hate earbuds i always have so this is how i listen to my music if i go out anywhereit has an amazing bass and great sound quality adding a great price you get an amazing product the bad thing is that ii could be a little uncomfortable if you have a big headwhen i received the headphones i was pleasantly surprised
i had to find some that were cheap as my turtle beach tbs ear force z was damaged
im glad i listened to the good reviews i foundsurprisingly the bass is deep despite the size and type of headphones
if you like or not that is a matter of personal taste
in my opinion i had never bought a pair of headphones that were so cheap and also had such a good soundone more thing these headphones are not pretty but its quality and durability are excellentthey sound every bit as good as my earsurrounding headphones
i find them much more comfortable than the now popular earbuds
i think they are stylish  geek styleim in my th year as host of a radio show on nprsan francisco
these are the headphones ive been using for the past four years great sound quality and as important very light and comfortable on the ear so i can keep them on for the entire show and never feel at all uncomfortable
if you want to look like a pro these arent for you
they look like what a teenybopper would wear
but if you want an amazing combination of sound quality comfort and low cost these are greatthey are clear crisp and have just the right amount of bass
you cant ask for any better sound from this style of headphone
i have actually made a couple friends very angry when i told them to try my headphones then ask what they cost and then complain that they sound better than their  sennheisersif you have a  dollar budget for headphones
stop looking
add to cart and buyid heard a lot about these throughout my internet travels and finally had to give in and try them out
im so glad i did
the sound exceeds my more expensive midlevel klipsch image one and i kind of like the way they look tooim serious though
dont let the looks fool you the portapros are performers
if these are anywhere near your budget just get themnote theyre not noiseisolating by any stretch but the fidelity more than makes up for thisi listened with portapro in jr  years ago and i was pretty surprised for the sound and bought itsince then i fell in love with portapro family series portapro sportapro ktx prothey all sound excellent full bass with its power clean human voice and crisp treble and theyre all wellbalancedtheyre pretty good headphones for portable portable cdmd players mp players pdas laptops even radiosi often suggest other customers to buy portapro and let them hear themselves and theyre happy with the soundthe only weakness is the cable it breaks easilyfor ktx pro users you can order portapro earpads to get same great sound as portaprohighly recommended on their own and especially if youre wanting to spend less than  on openair headphones in fact these are a lot less than  almost half thati ordered my koss portapros from amazon after having to admit the sennheiser hd  phones i ordered in august  were not comfortable and had muddy bass
i wanted some good headphones to use in the late evenings when my kids are in bed and i really wanted to love the hds
the reviews were great the price was great and they are sennheisers
all to naught
i should have listened to my gut and heeded the few reviews that commented on the boomy bassi had a pair of the original koss portapros back in the mid s and remember them very fondly
these current portapros are simply great headphones
they are clear free from distortion the bass is all there and punchy not boomy or muddy in the leastthe best thing i can say about headphones is that they dont just sound good for headphones they produce a very good sound
and these koss have great sound  really very excellentto be objective  i dont think id be quick to let a child use these
while the build quality feels good these arent made for rough handlingif you want some incredibly rugged excellentsounding budget headphones to have around for kids to use on computers mp players portable dvd players etc you cant go wrong with the panasonic rpht lightweight headphones
i buy these  pair at a time and always have a pair or two still in the packaging ready to bring out as neededi have been looking for a set of headphones that i could use with my ipod touch
i have tried many earbud type sets as they are the best for portabilty
i could not find a pair that could give me a wide spectrum of sound at a decent price
i do have a pair of ultimate ears metrofi v that came pretty close to what i was looking for they were a steal at  shipped from dell
however i needed a pair of headphones that were comfortable for extended periods and most of all sounded great
well after reading the reviews here i figured i would give these a try
i was shocked when i cranked up my ipod touch with some metallica and could hear all of the music without distortion
the koss portapros are very airy and do not cut off the world around you yet they produce a very clear and natural sound that is hard to find in any other headset under 
i am very picky about sound since i used to do sound engineering for a  piece band and got used to hearing a live wide range of sound with detail that is very percise
the bass response with the portapros is natural and clean the mids are natural and full and the treble is also clear and true
i am very pleased with these headphones and honestly the lifetime warranty sealed the deal
i remember when i was a kid in the early s
my father bought me a koss headphone set i cannot remember the model but listening to the current top  music of the day from my simple record player i remember how good those headphones sounded back then and how it would transport me into another world
looks like i just got back to my musical listening rootsgreat highs mids and lows for a  headphone you cannot go wrong period
i have the sennheiser px and may like these even more
more life and dynamicsokay so these shouldnt be in the noise cancelling section
however they are the bestsounding portable headphones ive ever owned period
simply powerful deep clear intense bass clear highs and fantastically accurate midrange
and unlike many bassheavy phones they dont suck the lifeblood out of your poor little ipodive been through all sorts of earbuds and cans and found these after experiencing great sound on a previous set of koss earbuds
ive never had any luck with the awkward fit of earbuds but i can also highly recommend the plug by koss if you have no problem with them  excellent bass and highs
anyway after comparing and contrasting these portapros to the other  pair ive bought over the years there is absolutely no contest when it comes to sound reproduction
sure they take up a bit more space than earbuds but they do fold up quite nicely in the provided fauxleather sacki use them every day for two hours on the subway and theyve gone thru the ringer
no cord problems no sound problems
the foam rips over the pads after awhile but with the lifetime warranty no worries if you have any kind of problems
 in shipping gets you a brand new pair no questions askedlastly yesokay they look mighty dorky  my coworker saw them and told me to get out of the eighties
but really its all about the music right
those hipster dorks who shop at american apparel wish they had this kind of stylei just bought these over the ear koss porta pro classic phones today
i traded in my ludacris soul sls and some sennheiser cxs for cash and i purchased these
love the sound
totally worth the deal it took to get these
tight but not overpowering bass and crisp mids and highs
i hear all the details in the music plus the energy exhibited in these phones is just phenomenal for the price
i bought these based on their being a top  value pick on cnet which ranked the klipsch ss as the top value headphones
i own two pairs of those and the koss porta pros and they couldnt be more accurate
retro look yet classy
compact
tight fit
tight sound
great price
no complaintshave used these headphones for the past  months mostly for travel including on airplane with an mp player and also at home with my computer
they are the best headphones ive tried particularly at this price level for sound quality
on an airplane they perform better than the noise cancelling headphones ive used because they maintain the full spectrum of sound without the muffling sound ive encountered with noise cancelling headphones
because of the low distortion ive been able to turn up the volume without hurting my ears to get past airplane noise
also there is little sound leakage so when you do elevate the sound level the passengers next to you wont be bothered as much by loud music
the headphones also fold handily so they are small enough to carry for portable use
at home the headphones perform with excellence on higher quality playback devices so they are useful when you want to listen to music by yourself
i highly recommend these headphones
if asked about the negatives i would say there are  things  the headband is a bit small and a bit difficult to adjust with the clip on metal  the design of these are old and this could be improved the cord is shorter than one would like and finally the earpiece is covered by foam like the old airplane headphones which deteriorate over time but fortunately you can buy replacement foam cushions here on amazon very inexpensively and they are easy to replace
look around on the net for reviews and you will find these are very positively reviewedthese koss portapros are the last headphones you will ever need with a few exceptions
the lifetime warranty is great if they every break and certainly adds to the value of the purchase
the headphones for their size are surprisingly portable and fit almost any head
the metal band can occasionally catch your hair which is why it didnt receive  stars for comfort
this style of headphone by design doesnt have very good noise cancellation which is why you may want to pick up a pair of ear bud style headphones for loud environments but the portapros still do a decent job with the task
sound quality is superb for this price range there is none better than the portapros and they can hold their own against headphones with double the price
these are a must have for people who want to get the most out of their music and videos
highly recommendedi was looking for a small light overtheear head phones to use in my office at work
still need to hear somethings going on around me
i didnt want an expensive set that i would have to lug home with me
researched the ratings on amazon and thought i would take a chance
hadnt really considered koss in many years
i have a few different sennheisers that i love but again wanted a small less expensive set
right out of the box i was wowed by the sound
i am sure they will improve once they are burned in
these are very light on my head and i have been wearing them for hours without any discomfort
there is a setting on the side for light for firm pressure the small blue tab shown in the picture just below the band
not sure i can tell much of the difference but i set them on light
these things foldup very small and can be stored in a small leatherette bag not a case and then fit great inside my desk drawer
again these had great sound and more bass than expected of something this size and cost
just a little tweeking with my sound settings on my siii and i was off and runningi own some high end cans and iems
these were bought as a walk around the house headphone
the big thing is how does koss generate such a rich sound out of an inexpensive headphone
i wish koss was still in the market as a high end headphone producer but if you need the best for what these cost go no further
be a little careful when taking them off because the earpods will snap together quickly due to the metal head band
theyre light comfy and can be somewhat adjusted for head pressurei love emive had my koss portapro headphones for about three months
i read good things about them in my online research and was particularly interested in the fact that they were said to have excellent bass for portable headphones
in fact they do as part of an overall rich nicely balanced sound
i also find them to be comfortable and convenient they fold up into a small circle and fit into a handy pouch
they appear to be well made and i anticipate using them for a long timei also bought a pair of the cheaper koss pro phones in a twofer amazon deal when i bought these and theyre excellent sounding portable phones as well
the metal construction of the portapros likely give them an advantage in durability the sound quality between the two is comparable
if youre interested in portable phones and want a better balance of highs mids and more lows than you usually get with such phones enough low end so that you wont need to use the annoying soundsucking bass boost found on most portable players with good construction to boot i highly recommend the portapros
theyll definitely sound much better than the phones that come with most walkmanstyle devicesthis must be the th pair of headphones ive purchased in the last  years
but ive finally found the one
i read the other reviews and went with this one based on the quality of sound
and its great
i am amazed at how much bass these things produce
they also fold up well and clip together
it should be easier to find the cord around them but thats just a minor annoyancejust unboxed these today and started listening to them and my first impression is that theyre quite possibly the simplest and most functional ive ever used
no frills no sexy designs no gimmicks no extra features just great sound and a fantastic functional design that has withstood the test of time
i read the reviews that others gave and i thought they cant be that good but for the price i didnt have much to loseprosadjustable earpieces work surprisingly well basically it just gives you the ability to change how much pressure the headphones put on your ears
i find that my ears get sore with most headphones but these are very comfortablethe adjustable headband will fit any head size
i havent got my hair caught in it yetthey fold up for greater portability and come with a very stylish leather bag probably fake leather not surethe sound is fantastic better than anything in this price range
clear mids and highs and decent bass that doesnt sound distorted when i crank itconsno manualdirections
they werent that hard to figure out but a simple sheet of paper with directions would have been nice
it took me a couple minutes to find out that you need to extend the headband then clip together the earpieces then retract the headband to make them small enough to fit in the bagim sure the foam earpiece covers will wear out but luckily they sell cheap replacementsthe leather bag is quite small and the headphones barely fit insideoverall great headphones
they do what they do and nothing more
perfect
update one year later i accidentally pulled the cord out of my headphones
i shipped them to koss and they sent me back a brand new pair for free but i had to pay  for return shipping
no nonsense or forms to fill out just a new pair of headphones in about a week
koss youve gained a lifelong customeromg
these are incrediblei never thought i would get sound this good from such a small pair of headphonesthe bass is unbelievable
they have the puchiness and crisp sound i want
you can hear and feel drum beats as if you were right there with the bandthe treble is also quite good you can hear everything
the voices  are smooth and not high pitched everything is balanced pretty well
but i feel the treble could be a touch higheri dont know if the bass is intentionally enhanced but it sounds a lot louder on these then any other headphones i have
but i like it certainly makes my music sound more alive and in your facealso worth noting these have a nice soundstage or stage presence if you will
mostly because they dont cover around your earsit would be great if koss made a version of these in an over the ear circumaural design
it would be nice to hear how it soundedfor a small portable headphone where sound isolation is not required these are my babieshere is what i own as of this review to show you to what im comparing fromonkyo txsr recieverkoss urkoss the plugpanasonic rphjekoss porta pro of courseaudiotechnica athprovwe have a split family and so its great to have amazingly clear headphones that can fold up that they love and move easily between homes without getting damaged
great purchasei bought these for my husband and he loves them
we are both more comfortable using the over the ear earphones rather than the ear buds that came with our ipods
he uses them for home and travelpros great sound
 portable incredibly comfortable they just look coolcons not so durable cord feels cheapi saw these on cnet as some of the best headphones along with ones that cost s of dollars and thought id give them a try
i am not disappointed they look great and sound even better
they fold up to a small size too and can fit in your pocket
they even come with a nice leather carrying pouchi had a pair when i was in college back in the mid s and they were tops thengreat sound hi and lownot for deep mega bass as it will not carry the bass punch
all othersget your koss on and enjoy comfortable headphones that are lightweight and custom fit to your ears and head for rich full soundi am very fussy about my music and the headphones that deliver that music must be good
the sound from these headphones is  crisp and clean
i sometimes feel like i am in the recording studio because i can hear every little nuance
the bass is present but not overwhelming
they are very comfortable to have on over long periods of time
they cover the ear but dont keep you from hearing whats going on around you
i dont like earbuds but didnt want huge headphones either
these are just right in size
they are adjustable both in length and in pressure against the ears
they fold up for travel
i have bought other headphones and keep coming back to these as my favorite
i think the price is incredible for the quality
i highly recommend themi really cant add more than others have written
yes i got my hair snagged the first couple times
once i figured how to take em on and off its been no big dealthe sound quality is fantastic
bass is present in spades
highs are well defined and havent gotten tinny on me
im not a fan of too much mid range and these give me all the highs and lows i want
comfy too
to the point i despise putting buds on when i workout
may get a nd pair just for working out
this is one product where the reviews on amazon are dead oncant recommend these highly enoughi may not be a audiophile but these headphones sound great
i was surprised by the deep bass in this headphone
some may be put off by it but i personally enjoy it
dont be fool by the picture of the portapro
they are quite thin and small when collapsed
these are definitely not headphones that you should be bouncing around in since it is so flimsy
overall for the price these are great sounding headphones for the pricethese earphones have been around a long time for a reason
although not as clear as bose noisecanceling earphones you cannot beat these earphones for the money
they work very well with an ipod
the bass is especially good and the music itself is a lot more precise than with the normal ipod earbuds
these earphones are well worth the moneyafter spending some time creating various playlists on spotify i quickly realized that listening to all those wonderful selections through my laptop speaker just didnt do justice to any of the songs
being on a tight budget i researched various budgetpriced bluetooth speakers and bought the jbl flip
the difference between the laptop speaker and the flip was needless to say outstanding
so i started listening to my playlists while working on the laptop and was quite happy to realize that i could turn up the volume quite high on the flip without experiencing any distortion
unfortunately my wife wasnt as enthralled as i was with my late night listening habit
i tried listening to the songs with the volume turned down quite low but lost the enjoyment of hearing all the details i could hear at a higher volume
still being on a tight budget i researched budgetpriced headphones and bought the koss portapros
i cant believe how much better the music sounds on the portapro compared to the flip
all the raves you read from other reviewers are true but can you see my dilemma
the flip sounds better than the laptop and the portapros sounds better than the flip
im now thinking that i will have to take out a home equity loan to move up to the next level
for the time being however im extremely satisfied with the portapros and will continue to listen to my music at whatever volume i want without irritating my wifeover three years old now and still work like a champsolid
cheap
sound goodi have owned these about a year nowwell madegood frequency responsecomfortablefair price for qualityallow external sounds to be heard this is good for me but maybe bad for otherslifetime warranty with registrationi have a pair of bose triport headphones ultimate ears stuidos and shure ec
i pick up the portapros every single time by preferencethe inear type block out other noises if you want that but for me this is one of the nice features of the portapro
i can turn the music on medium and still hear if somebody is driving up behind me trying to talk to me or trying to kicking down my door
if i set the music low i liken it to having a conversation with somebody and the music is in the background
as somebody that is very critical of everything i buy i can say these exceeded my expectationsi thought i would like the inear type but they are uncomfortable and if the seal in your ear canal is not perfect they have very poor frequency responseif you are looking for a nice pair of affordable headphones quit looking and buy portapros
once you get them go to koss website and register them for a lifetime warranty
bam you are set with great phones for a long timeif you dont mind looking like you should be listening to a tears for fears cassette on your enormous walkman these are fantastic especially for the price
lightweight and comfortable with bass response you shouldnt be able to reasonably expect from open air type headphones especially at this price point
i dont mind the eighties look to them they rock in any decade
but tomorrow i do think ill run in enormous striped tube socks pulled up to my knees just to complete the looki got a pair of sportapros kscs and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver
and to be fair i was confused
each headset has its own distinct feature and advantage
very frankly speaking the portapros price is what i believe koss cashing in on the hype since frankly speaking i do not see the  increase in any waythat being said the portapros do sound the best of the lot because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage
i guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers hence kind of closing it up a bit
the ksc have it in them to sound as good as these two but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out hence the huge drop in bass
press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and youll get what i meancomfortwise i would say the kscs win by a mile
you wont even feel that you have a pair of earphones on
the pads are good comfy and the same for all the three but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the kscssportapros definitely look odd
the kscs look uglier
love the design idea of the sportapro though the conversion to a behindthehead fit is genius and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it
the portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in
the sportas came with a nice gold plated cm to  adapter as well
packaging wise portapro is miles aahead of the rest well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros
the kscs do not have any bells and whistles in the pack but then again its almost rd the price of portasthe only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the kscs which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it make me skeptical about the longevity of the connectionthe kscs are the best bang for the buck definitely
but again even the most expensive portapro is less than half the price of its closest competitor from another companybut seriously kudos to koss for making some of the best headphones ive heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green onive read many reviews of portapro and have done some research for this headphones and other competitors like sennheiser and akg
i have to choose one of them because of limited budget haha
i chose this one because of my friend
he has koss sportapro which produces great sound and incredible bass
thats what i want
im very pleased with portapro
very nice high and midrange sound and impressive bass
i didnt say that this headphones are the best because some people still like sennheiser or akg
i think it is not much comfortable even if you adjust it to comfort mode
moreover even if you fold it its still bigger than pouch included in package
however i chose portapro because of sound and price
if you like powerful bass headphones and very nice highrange and midrange sound portapro will make you happyconsidering the price tag on these headphones the sound is amazing
you wont find better sound for this much money
even if you upgrade to something better these are good to keep around for working out doing chores around the house etc since theyre lightweight and fit pretty snugly
ive owned mine for a year now and they still sound greatupdate ive owned these for more than two years now and ive treated them like crap  wearing them when i work out when im doing chores working on the house etc
theyre indestructible and they still sound great
ive gone through at least three pairs of inear headphones in the same amount of time
buy these  theyll last you years
you do have to get used to having a line imprinted on your head after using them for more than five minutes at a time but i guess you cant have everythingthe audio quality is crisp basses are awesome
im not an audiophile but i really notice the difference which is big between these and other headphones
the music played by these can be played at low volumes and i can tolerate
very clear
one thing though music is leaked really bad by these after bout  wich is bad cuz u know ppl can hear what you hear and to me i dont like
its plastic and aluminium not the most durable of materials but hell with a lifetime warranty whos complaining
its either these or some  headphones
take these
your wallet and ears will thank youi bougt my koss porta pro in  for usage on a walkmanthe day i bought it i believe must have changed my life up to now  years 
i did not find any portable headphone that delivers more soundwhat makes this headphone so special is the dynamic it reproducesthe bass and treble that comes from this tiny package sounds like you are in front of a speakerwallthere are no words to describe the atmosphere it createswhen listening to classic music concerts its like you are therewhen listening to a singer its like the stage is in front of youwhen listening to pop rock disco dancefloor techno  you name it  it delivers the pump you would expect from big speakersthe clear vibrant trebles and the full deep bass it produces are just stunningi still remember the first time i used those the sound was so amazing it gave me this warm fuzzy feeling in the upper stomach area and left me speechless for a momentnote that over time the earpads and the pads which are supposed to hold the headphone in place will wear out and eventually come off
this can be a major turnoff when you want to go jogging with iti dont recommend wearing them long time or when you want to sleep because of the pressure on the earsthe little blue comfortzone switch is supposed to set how firm the headphone is attached to your head
i dont think thats working as advertised whatever the settings it didnt feel any different for me
the headphone is very light and foldable
when folded they are the size of a small applethe headphone comes with a softcasesummarythe speakers are not as compact as inear plugs but definitely have a better form factor than most pro headphonesthe fact that mine are worn out after many years of usage but still used confirms that the sound itself is well worth the pricewhen listening  especially first time  be prepared to be left speechless
as mentioned above they have a few short comings which product doesnt 
but it is still a product with well deserved  stars great sound out of these guys they have an excellent bass reproduction and treble is where it should be overall a wonderful balance
the midrange is excellent with instruments apparent i didnt know were there
they are also very light so if youre confident enough in how they look you can wear them aroundthe main point of my review was to say they are iphone friendly atleast the ones i got from amazon directlywould definitely recommend if you need something under a hundred dollarsi bought a set of the koss porta pro headphones based on reviews for my creative nomad c mp player which i also got from amazon
i dont think that a lot people realize that the limiting factor in listening to the mp format beside the size of the file is the set of headphones that you use
although they are not as accurate as my grado sr  phones they sound very good and are light enough to be used on the go
for small headphones they sound pretty open and detailed
they bass is very good
so good in fact that i turned down the bass eq on my mp player just a bit to bring the midrange forward and keep the voices from getting tubby
the treble is very clean sounding
if you got an mp player do yourself a favor and replace the stock headphones with these
i am pretty picky about sound quality
the koss porta pro headphones bridge the gap between light weight portable and delivering a musical experiencenight and day difference between these and either of my old sony headphones
blows away nano earbuds
money well spentyes they look strange
yes they look like a futuristic design from the sand indeed they are from the showever for the pricerange under  or so there is no comparison
still none
these things have been on the market for ages and folks still rightly rave about themi remember using these babies on an old sony sports walkman tape and the sound was amazingbig fat bass and loud
these are unmatched for bass period in portable headphone in this price range
they put the others to shameyes they are bizarrelooking and slightly awkward to fold up and the metal clip in the middle might rip out a hair or two
but if youre more concerned with the best sounding portable headphones for a discman or an ipod rather than looking cool on the street with coolerlooking but inferior headphones these things are perfect
highly recommended
no accident that koss an american company no less hasnt changed up the design of these in agesthey dont have to
if you want something a little sportier and smaller try the sportpro
not as powerful deep or loud but excellent in their own righti have been debating to buy these for a long time
finally i did and i am very happy i didsound is the best i have heard from this size headphones and it is also much more comfortable than i first thought it would bei cannot tell how it looks since i am wearing it
but who cares if the sound is so goodmy girlfriend swears that these are the best headphones shes ever had
call me crazy but i feel as though theyre starting to sound better than my grado srs toothey work well and seem very strong
more than enough length on the cord and extremely great soundsurprising good sound for the money
these things sound too good to be used for workouts
they have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat
i use these at work and i couldnt be happier with themlet me start off by saying i have owned these for many months and have enjoyed them thoroughly
the sound quality is amazing clear voice nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering
to the people saying they feel cheaply made mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one
they are fairly comfortable for what they are they fit great under a hoodie there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level
i highly recommendwho woulda guessed that the best sounding headphones under  would be a portable versionthe koss portapro are great set of headphones for the ipod classic
i read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so i gave them a try
wow the sound that comes from these headphones are greatno staticnoise
the fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size
i thought the metal would bother me i shave my head but no problem here i do not feel them
if you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not furtheryou have to here these to believe it
i went to a big electronics place where i live and they have alot of headphones on display and i mean alot i brought a cd player in with me and the koss headphones to compare i tried some that were  or more and they did not sound as good or better than these
and when the foam padding wears out you can replace them which you can not on the expensive ones you can get the foam pads through amazon alsoexcellent sound for the money
i only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them
she loves them and wont give them backthese headphones are some of the best ive ever had
sound quality and comfort are excellent
where have they been all my life
if you are considering purchasing these headphones dont hesitate just do it
they are well worth the moneyive had a terrible time finding headphones that i can wear for more than  minutes
first i wear glasses so that rules out a lot of over the ear headphones because it pushes the frames right into the sides of my head
the alternative then would be to use earbuds
i cant use earbuds though because the insides of my ears are extremely sensitive due to multiple infections as a child
i didnt think i had an alternative
fortunately i came across thesefor comfort these things are a dream
i actually forget that im wearing them sometimes which is a first for any headset ive owned
the pressure is applied above the ears as much as id like its adjustable and i can change how much pressure is on my ears and the side of my headdurabilitywise they seem to be fragilespecifically the part where the speakers connect to the headphone framehowever ive often stuffed them in my coat pockets yes theyre that small when folded up where theyve been squished against my shoulder bag and ive dropped them several times
its all part of being a klutz
i have yet to do any damage to them however
thats more than i can say about my portable mp playercomplaints the bag seems a bit small even with the correct way you put them in
i wouldve liked it if they made the opening a touch bigger so you could slip them in and out more easily
ive stopped using it altogether but i use them every day for at least an hour so it doesnt matter too much for meas for quality of sound theyve been excellent for me
i listen to a wide variety of classical rock and world music and its handled all of them quite well
i dont know how this would compare to say a  headset but for the price listed or under i think itd have to be the best out there
for comfort im not sure if these can be beatmy dad has had them for  years they still work as if they were new
my bro has them ive had them for a year and have gotten  people to get them toonothing beats them period
they deliver an incredible sound performance feel great dont leak too much isolate a fair amount of surrounding noise are unbreakable and extremely portableget them with no hesitationat first my son wasnt sure about the retro look of these head phones
now that he saw them in person he wears them everyday
first pair came and the right didnt work
amazon quickly exchanged it
great deali have been a portapro enthusiast for the past  years
youve already read the hundreds rave reviews of the portapros phenomenal sound and being that i am in agreement with them all i have little to add
i have several head phones from different manufacturers such as akg sony and sennheiser and these beat all the more expensive open air and closed air headphones i have
the only headphones that are better are inear variety which i use conditions with a lot external noise such as on planes and working out at the gymhowever recently i have fallen out of love with my portapros and i think there are a lot of portapro users who are in the closet about this particular design flaw that im about to elaborate on
first of all let me explain that i have several mp players
recently i acquired mp players with large amounts of flash memory gb
because of the long battery life inherent in these players  to  hours im pretty much listening to them all day long along with my portapros
i wear these instead of the better sounding isolation earbuds because i need to hear the phone and be able to talk to people while wearing themwith my extended hours of usage ive been noticing that when i remove my portapros about  times out of  they pull at least one of my hairs out
i have developed a method of slow removal combined with pushing together adjustable metal frame that reduces the instance of this
this acts to release any hairs that have been captured by the sliding mechanism
however because many times i have to answer the phone quickly i find myself having to pull off the portapros at more normal speed  and this results in too many instances of unauthorized hair removalbecause of the great sound of the portapro i have been will to put up with ituntil last nightlast night i was at office depot and on a whim i purchased the sony mdrelp fontopia earbuds with the windup case for about  bucks
these are the most generic basic earbuds that sony makes
over the years i have owned several of these and my experience with them was that these were entrylevel headphones with entrylevel sound
but when i plugged them in i was in for a pleasant shock
these sounded great
they must of done some design improvements since i last tried them
excellent full spectrum sound for metal jazz classical  everything i listen to
tight natural bass response that in my opinion is at least  of the greatness of the portapro  all for a measly  bucks
better sounding than the other headphones i have that cost several times as muchlong story shortive switched to sony fontopias for the time being
the fact that theyre not in the ear allows me to hear the phone and talk to people
but best of all  no hair pullingi still like the portapros for their sound
in fact a week ago i wrote an email to koss explaining the problem and they politely explained they were working a solution that didnt compromise the positive qualities of the current designthats cool
ill be waiting
for now ive hung up my portapros
if there are other folks out there who have a problem with hair pulling like i did the sony fontopia are a nice alternative for the beingrevision in recent months ive migrated back to using my portapros
im just more careful when i take them off
theres nothing else like the sound on these babies
while i hope you guys fix the hair pulling youre back to  starsive had  other pair of these headphones and ive never been disappointed
the sounds great and they seem to last forever
the other  pair
my wife got one and my daughter got the other
theyre especially good if earbuds dont work for you  like they fall off your head a lotsennheiser mxs have great sound too but i had  pair of those and in both cases the sound on one side went out
the first time i got another pair of mxs but the second time i got the portapro
cant imagine youd be disappointed with these  except maybe aesthetically
they do look a bit utilitarianoh koss portapro how do i love thee
let me count the waysthis pair of headphones is my favorite pair of portable headphones ive ever owned just barely edging out my sennheiser headphones i owned for years
theyre highly compact and yet still pack a punch providing rich full sound and gasp decent bass output as well something severely lacking in most headphones
the semihard case is also wonderful
i very very rarely leave the house without these headphones
they fit snugly and are barely noticeable even after hours of usemy somewhat trivial gripe with this product is that as a male with short hair the retractable metal band will pull out a single hair every now and then
very painful and somewhat frustrating but not worth taking a star awaymy familys been using these headphones for well over  years now and ive yet to find much better for the pricerecommended by cnet these headphones are light portable and have the best sound ive heard in this price rangei originally bought them for a laptop and now i use them on every audio device i own
great product excellent pricepurchased this to replace my  sony ear buds
sony is not bad but sounds a little dry and boring
i was surprised to hear the sound improved even when connected to a pc
bass sounds more natural not over emphasized as woofers do and midrange sounds fuller
yoyo ma sounds better with this compare to sonyeven though this is supposed to be on the comfortable side of headphones i still feel uncomfortable after using it for a while
i think it is the case for almost any headphonehowever this is not the best for conversation
i prefer my cheapo ear bud for skype which sounds a lot clearer
this is not a surprise since all telephones actually do filtration similar to that ear buds frequency response to make conversations clearer and save system resourcesby the way i got a chance to try a koss td
this portapro beats td hands down in sound quality
if you enjoy music but not on an am radio or very compressed files give this a tryupdate to improve the clarity in conversation skype or vocal i cut a hole in the center of the foam pad
now everything works beautifully
by the way its cheaper to order replacement pads through amazon
koss charges  for a pair while amazon sells a pack for the same pricethe sound is great the fit is great but the cushions are wearing off after whilewell guess that is kinda expected and falls under normal wear and teari just needed an improvement for home listening while on my computer
these are better than my old ones and avoids all the popping soundthese are outstanding headphones for the price with excellent response across the frequency spectrum and especially robust bass for such a small lightweight set
a friend recently visited me with a just purchased set of large overtheear type headphones
though his cost nearly three times as much he was chagrined to find after listening to a comparison that the koss headphones sounded better
a lifetime guarantee never hurts eitheri have owned two units so far and have gifted another oneat  youd be amazed with the sound these deliver
i bought one years ago  and they worked fantastic until one of the side gave out
that was when i discovered the noquestionsasked lifetime warranty from kossi mailed them the piece  explaining what was wrong and about  sh
and sure enough in four days they sent me a new unitfor the one i gifted i was on the fence about beats sennheisers and bose onear
tried them all out and personally i think the koss ones sounded way better and looked cooler too
i know the bose fans will hate this  but if they closed their eyes and didnt know which ones they were listening  i bet they would agree koss sounds better or at least as good as the bose onear phonesafter reading a very positive review of these headphones in computer shopper magazine i decided to buy three for use in my workshops and classesi like their light weight compactness and great sound quality
over time they may not take the abuse some of my students will subject them to
for now i am very pleased with themive had my koss portapro headphones for about eight years now
theyve served me well
i purchased them in circuit city one of the only local places where one could find them eight years ago and they have traveled from ipod to ipod served in some mild studio work and have basically been the best set of headphones ive ever had
they sound great theyre comfortable and they are durabletheres not much more to say
theyre starting to wear out just now and i guess ill be forced to buy a new set from amazon or invoke koss lifetime warranty within the next year or two
its good that theyre a bit easier to acquire now and the price is about rightim no audiophile but i do believe most people will find the koss portapro headphones to be superior to just about anything in the same price rangethese headphones are great
i cant compare their sound quality to those headphones costing  because i dont have that sort of cash laying around
what i can say is that these have a very wide range of frequency response giving clear resolution to both the highest and lowest tones and good clarity of vocals
they are very light weight and do not exert much pressure on my ears or anywhere making them very comfortable to wear for long periods
and although built lightly and compactly they do not appear to be too fragile
they actually do easily fold up and fit inside of the included  x  drawstring bag making them highly portable
they are just what i had hoped they would bei want to like these headphones
i bought a pair of sportapros and wanted a second pair tried the portapros as they seemed to get slightly better reviews
now i am wondering  what are people listening to
the sportapros sound so much better than the portapros that i have to believe something is wrong
no depth or layering or punchiness to the portapros
portas are mostly defined by overresponse in the treble range
im getting sound out of both earpieces so there is not a missing channelive heard all about the burnin for headphones but the sportas havent needed that and im not sure how much time to waste on these portas
i also own a pair of sennheiser hd which beat the heck out of the portapros but are somewhat on a par with the sportapros
now the senns seem to be sounding better with more use as i did not like them as well out of the box but do now
or my ears are getting burntin to their sound as i think happens alsois there something wrong with my portapros
i have no idea why there would be such dramatically poor quality in a product which most people seem to rate higher or on a par with the other phones i have
 update   another thing with these phones  the channels are reversed
listening to all ive gotta do by the beatles old stereo music one side vocals the other i have  sets of headphones where the vocals are right channel and the music is from the left channel
on these it is reversed and yes i do know how to put them on triple checked etc
wth is the deal with these
 another update  a accessories is sending me a replacement pair today even though ive already lost all my original packaging and stuff
so many thanks to them for so far great customer service
ill post on the new ones when they arrive
 update 
quick service from a accessories to replace my headphones and now the sound is much better
now i can compare these to my other phones and the sound is definitely comparable and channels are no longer switched
i am finding that the firm  light settings are very touchy
they dont want to stay on the light setting easily but that is a minor problem
i am now much happier and have changed my stars review to reflect thisi adore these headphones
they are definitely the best portablelightweight headphones i have used
amazing frequency response across the entire range
very comfortable even if youre wearing glasses
the lifetime warranty is a big plus toonot even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice exceptional is the first word that comes to mind
these are not just good for the price they are just good
there is always a satisfying feeling i get when i feel like i received more than i payed for and that is exactly what i received here
very highly recommendedexcellent product in every way
this product is light easy to use comfortable and excellent sound quality
all in all worth the moneythese are ugly as sin but comfortable to wear and the sound quality is excellent  so much better than the sonys i replaced with theseim admittedly sortof a brandwhore when it comes to sound
i like my klipsch sennheiser grados etc
i dislike bose for the cheap materials overmarketing business model
im annoyed by beats headphones that are just monster headphones with dr dres name and overboosted bass tones  but sold in awesome bright colors
hey i respect that beats is bringing attention back to cans i really do but theyre not good sounding headphonesi have a nice pair of sennheiser noisecancelling headphones i cant always wear due to headaches from the noise cancelling feature
also if im doing activities the sennheisers are huge and cumbersome not practical if im running washing my car or otherwise moving about quickly
i have a great pair of klipsch earbuds and those are fantastic for running
but they have poor bass responsethe koss portapros are fantastic almost mixing the best of both and leaving out the extras
it does not sound as nice as the either of the above mind you but you wont be left complaining
the bass response will destroy those of any earbudstyle headphone but you know that
koss drivers are more than capable of handling the meager power they receive and they do well to replicate bass from an ontheear designthe downside
yes the looks
hey theyre not brightcolored pastels that scream look at me
in fact they are ugly and say stay the hell away from me
but if youre not buying headphones for the image and you really shouldnt be then you shouldnt care
they look dorky for a reason though each side has a switch that allows you to set firmness allowing the buds to flex outward
this makes for very comfortable wearing
so if youre not trying to impress the kids at your high school and instead want to save some money and get good sound check out the koss portaprosthe best part is theyre so inexpensive if they ever do break or get lost stolen etc you dont care
if my brother lost his dres hed kill somebody
but my portapros
its  bucks man
i just go order another
di ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both
have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great
not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that i keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those eitherthese are old school small headphones and are not particularly stylish
ok theyre ugly
that said the sound is waaaay excellent
get over it
do you want sound better than phones costing  to  times this much or do you want to be stylish
at  youve really got to give them a try
dont be misled by a few average ratings because audiophiles are notoriously inclined to diss everything but their favorites
i have a good music system plus a high tech computer with an excellent sound card and these headphones rock on bothi know these headphones are not as cool as dr dres but they have excellent sound and bass
they are comfortable to wear and store easily
highly recommendedi bought these a the px s and girlfriend pick the px s i got these i like the style and the sound is a huge step up from the ipod in ear phones
i also dig the warranty that koss gives these
i have to admit the sound is a little more defined on the sennhiesershow do you spell it
but the difference is not worth quibbling over
you will be happy with either pair but the px s stay in place on her head better ive got a bigger dome so if you have a small head go for thosethese koss headphones are well priced and nice audio quality for mp quality recordings
not good for noisy environments since they are open style and relatively small but very comfortable for long sessions of useif you dont have these headphones then you bought the wrong pairbose is nice these are nicer
bose cost  these are under  and sound betterno they are not noise canceling
yes they are more comfortableokay so they are the ugly ducklings of headphones but they sound awsome
these are my third pair
i just wear them to deaththey rock the headthis is the th pair of these headphones
the connector problem has been fixed andthe sound continue s tobe freat
the nit curls up into easily transported ball
i can t imagine flying withojt themfro the price these are hard to beat
i love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point
lifetime warranty as wellive had these headphones for around a year now
they are great sounding and quite durable
they feel kind of cheap but even my  and  year old sons couldnt break them they break or lose almost everything i get them
the most outstanding feature of these phones is the smooth and accurate sound you get from them
i use my pair with a zune mp player
they blow away the standard ear buds as well as my monitor headphones and the skull candy headphones i bought
the only complaint i have is the styling
since im not trying to make a fashion statement i have to give them  starsjan
  i have owned these headphones for over  years now and i have to say i love them as much today as when i got them
they have held up quite well with only a small problem developing at the plug end of the cord
where it enters the plug end the rubber has become frayed
i remedied this with my hot glue gun
i was going to send them to koss under the lifetime waranty but didnt feel it was worth the shipping costs
i just bought new cushions because the old ones are quite crushed at this point
everytime i go to the store to sample headphones i come away thinkig these sound as good or better than the ones they have on display
ive tried the sonys skullcandys klipshe etc
the only ones i like better are the more expensive over  sennheisers bose bowers and wilkins and audio technica
i havent heard the grado or beyerdynamics headphones so i cant comment on those
for portable use you would be hard pressed to find a better headphonerd set what else can i say lol  they have always been a little heavy on the base but as a work horse they are perfectwhen i was much younger like  i had a pair of koss headphones that i bought at a local music shop for like 
ive never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again
they technically still work but i broke the connection between the headphone and the head bandive been using sennheiser hds at work for a few years now
but the bass was never terribly pleasing
i had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old koss headphones over christmasthese things are amazing
the base response blows the sennheisers out of the water and yes i know they are twice as expensive the comfort unbelievable
i have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better to me than the  beats they had on displayi gotta say these things rock
frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like theseporta pros can be broken easily but mostly is snapped back audio technica under  oo great too for under weve had these headphones for about  years until the kids finally finished them off when trying themthese headphones are great for using in gym
they designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when youre joggingthe sound quality is simply amazing for their price
the design looks sort of dated but thats because theyve been produced without change for more then  years nowive bought the same model now to replace the broken oncehighly recommendbought my first headset by koss ktxpro titanium at least  maybe  years ago
got it at a drugstore for about 
it finally failed a week ago
not completely just wore out foam ear covers and developed a spotty wiring problem
i was faced with replacing the best headset a picky picky audiophile like me could find
i spent a lot of time reading reviews and bought this one
and boy am i a happy camper
dont waste anymore time
get this headset
rich deep base clarity no distortion of sounds in background
i cannot imagine a headset that could sound better than this one
its extremely comfortable
the wiring is a lot thinner and i may worry about damaging it
only disappointment was the case included
its not a case but rather a black bag made of a synthetic material
i folded the headset to try to use the bag and stopped
i dont want to cram like crazy and damage the headset to get it in the little bag
ill use the bag for other electronic gadgets
my old reliable koss headset came with a volume control and this one is missing that dandy feature
thats the only thing its missingi have been using these for about a month now
i have done some traveling working out and simple listening at work with the porta pros and i love them so far
the bass is great the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones and they are comfortable on my earsi would definitely buy another pairive owned these for  years and they still sound great
lifetime warranty crisp sound good base for portables sturdy comfortable
get themi find earbuds to be very uncomfortable
these koss portapros were perfect for replacing the earbuds that came with my mp player
they are comfortable to wear have great sound for the price and have a little stylish pizazz
they are easy to fold up and put into a suitcase or purse for travel
im very happy with my choicei have two sets of these headphones  one has been my companion in my gym bag for about  years and the other has gone traveling with me over many trips in my computer bag as well as used frequently at homei probably have a dozen pair of good to excellent headphones including various sennheisers grado sr  shure superfi pro  sony mdr v and v etchonestly these porta pros do not offer the best sound quality in the world
but they might be the most comfortable
and the sound quality is pretty darned good with excellent bass for a headphone so small
they are easy to carry around and i have found them to be surprisingly durableby comparison i also have the sennheiser px s
the sennheisers are ok but not as comfortable and the sound is more muffled
i always go back to the porta pros
in fact no matter what ever headphones i try i always go back to the porta prosthese have been around a long time but no one has yet made a better portable headset
usually i dont like to jump in with a me too review when there are this many people who have already written a review
but these headphones are that good and i recommend them to anyone with an ipod or other mp playeri came to these headphones after coming from  shure e earbuds that broke and these headphones are certainly on par if not better than them
i loved my shure earbuds and i love these a heck of a lot more
the sound quality is superb and while there have been complaints about the bass for some its definitely not a deal breaker
personally i appreciate the little extra bass these give
its not overwhelming but it is noticeable that these headphones have more bass than others
there are two major things that people may be concerned with with this product the adjusters at the top of the band catch a few hairs on your head and may pull a few out as theyre being removed
having short hair is beneficial with these headphones but if you have long hair simply hold the adjusters in place as you remove them and remove them gently
youll have no problems otherwise these headphones leak sound just like any other headphone of this type
if this bothers you you may want to look elsewhere
the sound leakage isnt super loud or annoying but if youre in a quiet room and listening to rock music at a moderate level a person a few feet from you will notice youre listening to musicotherwise the sound the comfort and the price makes these headphones worth it for anyone who is looking for a great pair of headphones
they easily stand up to headphones within the  price range and sound just as good for a fraction of the price
no these are not too good to be true
you wont be disappointedive had two pair of these
lost the first pair and replaced them
light weight and great sounding and easy to store with a life time replacement warranty
you just cant go wrongthese headphones are an amazing value and very well designed
the headphones are small yet the design is such that they firmly yet comfortably fit on your head
there is a small button allowing adjustment of how much pressure is exerted
the drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the earsthe sound is superb especially considering the size of the phones
the bass extension is very good and satisfying much better than comparably sized phones
the overall sound is neutral and nonfatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tiredone thing to note is that headphones typically are open or closed design
a closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments
open headphones like the koss portapros are designed for use in quiet environments
so if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane these are not designed for that type of useanother very important feature of koss phones is the lifetime warranty
i have had my koss portapros for over  years now
i have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out
i sent them back to koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling chargesee their website for details and they promptly refurbished my headphones and even put on new pads to replace my old pads
other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones
so if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use the lifetime warranty is a big plusthose interested in small open style phones may also want to check out the sennheiser px which delivers similar performance though the px has less prominent bass and more midrange the typical sennheiser sound
both are excellent values but in my mind the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the koss phones a slightly better dealbought these to replace a pair that gave up the ghost after  years
best investment then and now
a classic like this should never die
hopefully they never willwhen i lived in sweden about  of the population had these headphones
they were extremely popular
now i know whythe sound quality on these things is amazing comparable to  headphones
the only headphones i have listened to so far that have better sound quality are some more expensive sennheiser headsets
the bass is really booming and there is crisp treble and pretty nice midrangethey are extremely portable too
i can fit them in the pockets of my shorts when folded uppretty durable cable too and it doesnt twisti highly recommend thesefair sound great price and the collapsed form factor makes them quite transportablewill update this review in a few months after seeing how they hold upthey been making these the same way since before i was born and they havent changed a thing
after years of loyal service i finally abused my pair to death and i wouldnt order any other headphones to replace them
theyre lightweight and i often forget im wearing them
they do great bass simulation and i can hear instruments i cant detect on other headphones
there are some downsides too but none of them are dealbreakers
it has a weak size adjusting slider that can snag your hair and the dated s design is kinda ugly
they have no noise cancellation so sound will start to leak before my ipod reaches half volume and for something called the porta pro they arent particularly portable
they fold up but they dont fit in your pocket
still  you cant find a better lightweight pair of  headphones in this price range
they work great and except for the occasional hair snag  theyre comfy  but best of all they wont break the bank to deliver a quality sound
take the pepsi challenge and compare them to other headsets
youll see theres a reason theyve earned a cult followingtake what other reviewers have said about these headphones believe them and then multiply it by  i received a pair of koss urs as a gift years ago and loved them  so naturally i looked to koss again when replacing my portableonthego headphones
after buying a pair of kscs which sounded great but were uncomfortable for me personally i hopped on amazon and found everyone raving about the portapros
i figured they were good especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the s which has to mean something but i also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true
however these are barnone the most amazing headphones i have ever put on my head
listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those wow moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely
the bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light comfortable headphonesi dont know what im impressed with the most the amazing bass the excellent stereo division or how loud they can get
these things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more i was worried about the eighties styling but in person they dont look bad at all
i hate headphones that scream for attention but these dont look like that when you have them on and i have already been wearing them in public something i didnt think i would do after only seeing the picture of them online
and even if theyre a bit outdated in appearance the design is so functional you wont even give looks a second thought after you put them onone thing is for sure these things have plenty of bass
not too much not boomy but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without bass booster turned on which i like
even with the bass settings adjusted high the bass remains clear and crisp
im not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them but i listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all
after a few days my left speaker began making some weird noises and it ended up being a hair stuck inside the headphones that i cleared out with canned air
something important to consider is that these are very open and airy headphones and the treble carries very well outside the headphones so someone nearby could definitely hear what youre listening to if you have the volume up loudothers have mentioned that they felt the headphones were too tight feeling but i have a very large head and they fit me without a problem
however if i will be wearing them for an extended period of time i always set them to the light setting on the comfortzone control which divides the side pressure of  the headphones with your temples rather than just on your earsi already had headphones i was pleased with sony mdrgs and koss urs but i wanted a set of small portable headphones for use with my laptop and these are perfect
the folding design isnt something i necessarily wanted but it is nice
the carrying case they come with a leatherette bag is a slightly tight fit and i probably wont end up using it much since it is not a hard case that would protect them from shock or crushing
some others have mentioned that they feel delicate or are easily broken but compared to other small headphones i have had they seem very well built and equally strong considering their light weightwhile i wouldnt say these are bad things about the portapros it is worth mentioning that the headband is metal and will occasionally snag a hair as you adjust it on your head and that they dont fold down as small as you might think they would so dont expect to put them in your pants pocket or something
considering these are the worst things i can come up with to say about the portapros they are nearly perfect in my booki cant say enough good things about these portapros
theyre simply amazing
these are the first headphones or speakers ive had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass
they sound good on everything from rampb to country and everything inbetween
ive been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill tinny treble that plagues so many headphones
if there ever was a question about the quality of koss stereophones in my mind these portapros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer
if youre like me youll wish you had discovered these legendary headphones haha
how often is that said
years agomy family is hard on headphones
this is the only pair of headphones of any type in my household that has made it six months
the koss portapros are comfortable and have a very transparent sound
highly recommendedthese may be a throwback to the seventies but the sound is great
the only concern you might have is that they dont block out much outside sound and since the cups are open they allow those around you to hear what youre listening to if you really have it cranked upi wanted good headphones that we overon ear with good balance of sound at a reasonable price and these headphones worked out perfect
i got these to listen to music and podcasts and found these handle the full range with out being too bassy compared to dre beats or other highend headphones
i have found that many highend headphones bill themselves as such because they can produce a lot of bass but end up sacrificing range and clarity
i wanted a pair of good headphones and were looking at some sets that were  and decided to take a shot at thesethese work for all types of music which i have tried classical hiphop rock and roll and dub stepi used them at work and a couple of times at the gym with no issues in either arena
they will block out the background noise of the gym and the pads dont soak up sweat like other headphones i have ruined in the pasttwo issues are the looks and the comfort
the looks are something you will get used to
i have found that these can get uncomfortable after wearing these for a couple of hoursprogreat soundgreat bassgreat rangegreat priceconlookscomforti bought these headphones after my koss earbuds finally developed a short after many years of use
i stayed with koss because i had been very satisfied with these earbuds as a significant improvement over the apple earbuds for an ipod
and i was hoping for a bit of an upgrade with these headphones
but i didnt expect this significant an upgrade
when i first listened to them i was a bit overwhelmed by the bass
i had some concerns with an overly heavy bass because of some reviews mentioned this
but the more i listened the more i loved it
i was simply hearing the bass in a way i had been missing with my earbuds
and i mostly listen to jazz with these headphones so its not like im looking for a heavy rock bass here
i was just very happy to hear the bass as well defined as it was with these headphones right now gary smulyans baritone sax sounds amazingly full
and the rest of the sound is excellent as well
my only regret now is im getting used to this much bigger sound so im less blown away by what im hearing than when i first made the upgrade
but i have only to listen to some earbuds to get that wow feeling againanother feature which attracted me to these headphones which didnt dissapoint is their portability
i like to take my earbudsheadhones with me when i travel and dont want to lug big headhones around which take up a lot of space
these headphones fold up into a kind of ball which almost fits in the palm of my hand
and theyre very comfortable to wear
the comfort zone settings come in very handy
moving the setting from firm to light makes a difference you can easily notice in how the headphones feel
i find that i prefer the setting right between the extremes there are three settings in allso unless youve got something against s style and are concerned that youre just going to look too wierd with these things on they are the perfect listening device to use with an ipod or at least thats what i use them with that combines great sound and portabilityyep its old style that is back instyle
these are the best sound quality reproduction lightest easy on the ears headphones i have ever purchased
great for the laptop mp player stereo system or your tv
koss has not changed a thing in over what  years i think and now i know why
they work great
check this out my  yo
was shocked at the quality he didnt want to give them back to me
hahastill love the porta pros which play in the much more expensive leagues when it comes to sound
koss really nailed it with the porta pros which are much more valued in europe i found out from a friend
excellent warm sound a bit bassy but not enough to ruin the experience not at alli bought this from amazon specifically for my twenty hour airline journey
most of my music i hear is lossless format on ipod converted from cd using eac software
i am a guitarist and musician and use various studio monitors and get very easily disappointed by bad quality
i am very impressed by the tightness of the sound coming out of the headphones
the bass is well definedthe headphones are very comfortable to wear and for a guy with a shaven head thats an important criteria as well i will definitely recommend these headphones to friendslastly the price just blew me away 
koss could have charged much higher than this but someone out there is a music jedi  may the force be with kosssound is
greatprice is greata little fragile but take care and it will give you a light weight headset with full soundi bought these two months ago after reading all the rave reviews and was not dissapointed
im amazed that portapro are just 
i own a pair of vmoda inear phones that costed me more than double the price and a pair of seinnheiser pmx
i can safely say that portapro are far superior sounding than the other two
the best part is their bass
mids and highs are great as well
pretty comfortable to wear
the only thing im not a big fan of is their s look
but headphones are for listening so im over the looks
highly recommendedi was a little skeptical at first because these are cheap paid about  and the design is a little different but wow
the sound is phenomenal i make my friends that have the beats and soul studio headphones who also paid  listen and they are jealous of the huge sound
unless you just want to blow your  on those to get a rappers brand name get thesesummaryproshuge soundstage great bass but not overpowering
good clarity in mids and the highs can sparkle if you want them to even with bass
brings music to lifehear it like never beforeinteresting design get lots of questionscomplimentsprice  are you kidding me  for this high quality
thanks kosscomes with decent case and headphones are collapsible to easily carry in a backpack or pocket evenconscord seems a little short but not bad
about  feet
im used to longer cords on studio headphoneskeep in mind these are on ear therefore let outside noise in a little
also keep in mind you can turn these up really loud
lolhighly recommend these little headphones
if you are in the market for anything under  get thesei was due for a new set of headphones and as i despise earbuds i searched carefully and found these superb phones from koss
they are not expensive yet if you are particular about your music your  ears will hear sounds other headphones could not reproduce
i can wear these all day and they are not so large you look like a relic from the s
they fold closed and come with a leatherlike bag
the bass is clear and not muddy the highs are clean and not painful to the earthis model has been in production continiously since  without change
koss hit it right with thesei have owned a lot of headphones over the years and i have never found any reasonably priced headphones that approach the sound quality that these have
yes they arent exactly stylish  the design dates from the s and it shows
but there is a reason why they are still for sale after all these years
you dont survive in a business as competitive as consumer electronics for all this time unless there is a reason for itthey arent perfect for all occasions  i wouldnt go running with them because the oldschool foam pads would eventually get sweaty and nasty
you could use them on a plane but they dont have any soundisolatingnoise cancelling features and they dont isolate your ears
but for like commuting on the subway at work or to watch movies on your laptop after your wife is asleep they are perfect
good base response but nicely balanced throughout
crisp not muddy at all
they hold up well if you dont abuse them i had a pair years ago and they lasted a long long timei am most certainly not an audiophile but these headphones came highly recommended not only from other sites but from other people i know
they are a classic design from the eighties which is now nouveau chic againi am a heavy heavy tech user and like to use high quality items and i demand a lot from themwith that said these are my new favorite headphones the ones that travel with me everywherei was skeptical even after reading all the reviews thinking how could something so reasonably priced really be as good as all of these reviews suggest
well they can be and are consider my doubts banished as i was pleasantly surprised
the reviews are correct this is koss masterpiece homerun the epitome of what koss representsi have a pair of bose triport headphones and senneheiser pxs both of which are excellent headphonesand these porta pros are commandingly better the triports are warmer and the senneheisers crisper but i like the sound of these best as they are the cleanest clearest balance of warmth  crispnessthey are light weight foldable exceptionally comfortable and of coarse the sound quality is excellentactually i cannot say enough about the sound quality it is well balanced full hits the highs lows and everything in between accurately
they produce clean scratch that pristine audio that is a pleasure to listen to
i find myself searching out music that can challenge or push these and they just keep on producing beautiful music to my earsessentially they are awesome
period they sound and function better than headphones easily two or three times their price look cool if youre into retro and they are dirt cheapconcernsthe only concerns if any are that the part that connects the earpiece to the headphone part doesnt seem very robust and may break eventuallythough i havent had any issues
some may find that the metal headband might catch on their hair something else i havent had an issue with though i have short hair and finally the foam pads over the earphones sort of scream im cheap and i will wear out on you
in defense of them it does keep with the whole retro thing its really comfortable its easily replaceable and they are in fact inexpensive essentially who cares
many of these small things have been ever so slightly adjusted on the anniversary edition of these gorgeous nearly perfect headphones but for twice the price i wouldnt bother
oh and koss has an included lifetime warranty for the life of the product ridiculous
amazing for me this tosses basically all of the concerns out the windowconclusionbeautiful design and function form and function married beautifully just one of those products that is right on balanced perfect in most ways clearly the designers got it and knew what they were doing when they made thesekoss famous lifetime warrantyworth every penny i would feel good about paying twice the price and wouldnt bat an eye
awesome part is you dont have to
i would buy them again for myself or othersfour star sound quality for under 
very comfortable with solid construction
the review on cnetcom is spot on
i could not be more pleased with this purchaseive been using these for many years mostly for playing music during workouts
i am a fan of really high end headphones sennheiser s and although my koss phones arent quite up there with them they really do satisfy
great bass great presence and you could run over them with a car and theyd still work
when i bought these more than ten years ago the dealer whom i trusted said these are the best
he was absolutely rightby the way i recently listened to the headphones currently marketed as koss porta pros
happily koss hasnt changed a thingtom hurleyim a headphone nut and have  worth of highend headphones lying around three pair
i also have a pair of koss portapros which are identical to the portapro other than lacking part of the adjustment mechanismdespite all this high end audio goodness around i still use and enjoy the portapros
they offer maybe  of what my other headphones have for th the price and are much more portable of course
ive owned and enjoyed several pair over the years including the radio shack iterations and have always been wowed by the sound quality
they were my introduction to better than stock earbud soundi think they would be a better deal at  but they are still worth the money at close to 
the bass can get a bit overbearing at times im no basshead but otherwise they are excellent
also note that they are completely open and perhaps not the best choice for noisy environments like on a plane or busi gave it  stars because for the price these are about the best headphones you can get sans a good sale
i recommend it to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones you dont need an amp witha highquality headphone like this is something that will change the way you hear music
the full bold clear sound it produces is heavenly
ive been hearing all my old favorites songs which ive heard thousands of times and in many of them i notice sounds and instruments i never picked up not in my jbl speakers not in my old crappy dell speakers not in any of the other various headphones ive ownedit is very comfortable to use very adjustable it has adjustments on both arc length and speaker angle and looks durable too even with all the folding it needs to perform to fit in the small bag it came withi first tried these headphones in the base exchange while i was stationed in germany during my tour in the service
i compared them to a dozen brands they had including full ear professional sets like akg and sennheiser
as mentioned previously these have the most incredibly tight and full bass
the tweeters put out crisp clear highs  especially brass
i bought them on the spot and wore them daily until one day i accidentally pulled the wire out of the phones
i sent it back to the factory with  shipping and had them back good as new in less than  weeks
the earphone mounting design while comfortable is not very sturdy
the earpieces snap into the headset and have a central pivot point which is made of plastic of course
well i broke that piece and the earpiece would not stay on the headset so i sent them to the factory with  and they fixed them again and shipped them back quickly good as new
bottom line when koss says lifetime warrantythey mean it
i still have them actually im on my third set now and if these wear out ill buy them again
oh and did i mention they sound great tooyou know how noisy the nyc subway is
this product is totally amazing block out the noise but still can hear the announcement
nice deep base tooi have had many sub headphones from  panasonic to  sony with sennheiser hd   px ii i really wanted to like these pxii they were so very well designed and even a grado sr for awhile
and what it basically comes down to is value
i have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the  range easily the best under 
i cant believe theyre over  years oldits hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull
i listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country and these headphones are suitable for all types of music
the only fault in the sound is the bass
its just a slight bit boomy but you get to like it after a while to be honestthe design is from the s as you all have probably figured out
it could use a update but it seems like koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past
i dont really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it i have very short hair even for a malebut despite its design flaws its the most comfortable headphones i have ever worn and the best part is that its also the best sounding pair of headphones i have ever heard under if you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you there is nothing even close to this at this price rangethis one is an absolute gem
i loved these so much i ordered two of the th anniversary ones for a bit moreupdate i read some reviews about the pxii being much improved and better sounding than the portapro
since the pxii is relatively new i thought id give it another listen
this time i noticed something different
the sound is warm mellow and neutral but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes
i still prefer higherdetail portapro but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the pxiioh by the way the portapro comes in the straight plug now not the angled plug anymore
its supposed to be for better compatibility with the ipods and iphones out therehappy with koss portapro
light comfortable adjusts easily great sound quality while allowing to hear a phone next room ringingwhat porta name has to do with it beats me
not sure what to do with the little bag enclosed or the fatter adaptor bushing that came with it but a nice touchhappy earsi have had these for about six months now and gotta say that theyre great value for money
i listen to death metal classical jazz classic rock trance  and these do all of them justice
midrange guitars dont sound muddy bass is punchy could be a bit bass heavy for some and highs are not screechy at allthe thing is the design hasnt changed a whole lot since the s when they were first introduced
they are openair headphones meaning that they leak soundboth ways
so dont wear these on a subway or in a loud area as they do not block out sound at allthe adjusting mechanism hasnt affected my hair as much as others here but it is still an issue
extend the phones beyond your head size then adjust down
this way your hair wont get pulled out as oftenthe cord is pretty thin and the plastic construction means that you gotta be pretty careful with them ive knocked them around a bit in my jacket pockets and backpack though and havent had any problemswith regards to comfort i wear glasses and many other headphones press my ears to my head so hard that my glasses indent the sides of my face
not comfortable at all
these thanks to those weirdlooking comfort pads above the ear pads dontother headphones tend to make my ears heat up
not theseoverall a great pair for the price and the portability just makes them that much betteri agree with those who say the look is retro but i have to say the sound is fantastic especially for 
i compared it to my full size sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great
when playing various styles of music youll find it does sound better on poprockcountry music compared to classical music but it was no slouch on the classical side
it really brought my laptop to life whether it was music or a movie
i would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair but that wasnt too diffucult
my son tried it and he wanted to trade the sonys i gave him i told him he was out of luckthis sound much better than sennheiser px  owned for about  years
it is comfortable on me but i just dont like style
px look betterthe sound from these headphones is top of the line its a pleasure to listen to my music with these phones
they are light on the head and stay that way using them for extended amounts of time
dislikes  i dont like having to adjust them each time i put on my head but you soon forget doing the adjustment soon as the music starts
the cable is a little short for me but works
i would recommend these phones but you have to be gentle with them especially with the connectorive owned many different headphones before including asony mdrv monitor series headphones with ccaw voice coilan incredible headset in its own right and listened to some high end sets that friends have including a set of akg k studio headphones and these are easily my favorite
i will always love my sony mdrv but due to a recent change in my listening needs i needed a pair of open cans portability being a huge plus
i considered the grado prestige series sri stereo headphone but those didnt really look very comfortable and arent particularly portable
i gave these a shot and considering their price and heritage why the heck noti have absolutely nothing but praise to say for these cans
they are amazingly comfortable probably the most comfortable set of cans i own
the comfortzone system really works and allows you to balance pressure between the ear pads and head pads
why koss or another company hasnt implemented this system in newer sets is beyond me it allows you to releive the pressure on your ears when your just kicking back and listening or increase the pressure when youre moving around
of course these arent sport phones and are less than optimal when youre very active for that i would recommend the less comfortable but acoustically similarkoss ksc portable stereophone headphones
i havent found the headband to be uncomfortable at all but i do have quite the thick dome of hair protecting it
you might think this would cause the hair pinching problem some have complained about but i havent had that problem yet
the portability is respectable they do fold up into as someone says a pokey baseball
the case is pretty worthless and too small but whatever its really not necessary
the looks well are subjective
i think theyre very unique and in a way personify the antibeats by dr dre look which in my book is a great thing but most normal people might not agree
who cares what they think and of course the most important aspect the sound quality
i find these sound absolutely excellent
the response is geared more towards listening pleasure and not flat response so these wont be any good at studio monitoring or mixing but they also dont need a ton of eq adjustments to make listening enjoyable unlike my vs
personally i only bring up the extreme lows and highs just a little bit and they sound great like that
very detailed bright punchy and excellent response across the entire spectrum except for the extremely low end of the spectrum
to get solid response in the subhz region youre probably going to have to find a closed set or a set with larger drivers
it just comes down to the limitations of physics at that point
other than that the sound is amazing theres really nothing else to say
just make sure to give them a good long breakin perioda word of warning i should mention is not all of them come from the factory in perfect working condition
the first set i had poor bass in the left channel in about the subhz range
this is one of those defects thats hard to detect since bass isnt directional and for awhile i though maybe i was going crazy
i was able to isolate this by listening to each side individually by pulling the other away from my head and was able to deduce the problem with the left channel perfectly using that method
amazon was great about the replacement and my new set is perfectmy only criticism about these cans would be the way koss packs them
they wrap the chord up so tight i doubt the kinks will ever fully come out
i observed the same quirk with the ksc koss needs to either start wrapping the chords less tight or use a more pliable rubber in the chords
this annoyance is really the only indicator of how affordable these really are
replacing the chords with a better quality set would probably be a worthwhile mod and one im considering doing
then again that would probably void the excellent lifetime warrantyoverall these are an amazing set of cans
there really is no excuse whatsoever not to give them a try theyve been made the same way for over  years and once you use them you realize why they shouldnt ever change a thing
theyre a true legend and even if the price was double what it is they would still easily be worth the money
recommended without any reservation whatsoeveroh and a note about the photos the actual plug is a goldplated straight plug unlike the steel rightangle plug in the picture
the  to  adapter is entirely goldplated as welli needed a replacement for broken ksc and decided to try these
i didnt find portpro very comfortable they press against ears a bit too hard for my taste so i couldnt wear them for too long
but
the drivers can be easily detached and attached to kscs clips
this combination turned out to be very comfortable
why not just buy cheaper ksc then
well the sound of portapro drivers is a step up
unlike some other reviewers state as far as i can tell the portapro drivers are the same as ksc and not ksc
they do sound different to my ear with portaproksc being more detailed and crisp but still retaining rich warm bassy is there such a word
sound i like so much about ksc
you may also consider ksc which is basically portapro drivers with clipon instead of headband as far as i can tell koss only sells them directly from their websiteamazing sound at an amazing price
they are more bass heavy than the ksc
together they compliment each other very welli have been listening to headphones over the past  years or more
from akg sony b and o bose senheiser and among others such as the overpriced beats by dr dre  after listening to earbuds i have found that the sonic quality price and comfort cannot be beat at this price point
for less than  including shipping these headphones are a dream to listen to
with the adjustable temple force you cannot get anything better to listen to music from many different sources
i dont abuse headphones so these will last me a long timejust received thesei ordered directly from amazon after receiving a fake pair of the red ones on ebay
i suggest buying these through amazon not other sellers  do not try to save a few bucks and get ripped off
i would not even purchase them from amazon sellersagain buy the ones through amazon directly
please do some online research to see how to spot a fake
if you have any inklings that you may have gotten a fake contact koss
they will not refund your money but will try to find the seller and deal with it
these are really good headphones for the price
i also have a pair of sennheiser s that were a tick cheaper but they are not as clear as these
not sure how they will hold up but koss lifetime guarantee is really great thing ive read
again be sure youre getting the real thingthere are fakes out there biggest issue is bad spelling on packageskoss would not do that
glad i did online reasearch as this pair i received from amazon sounds way better than the fakes did
do not make that mistake
buy from a reputable seller
hope this helps yougreat headphoneslook out for fakesthis little headphone produces beautiful sound with comfort i liked the retro look and think its cool
after reading so many positive reviews and saw it on sale for under  why not
i am so glad i did the shipping took longer than expected about  weeks but its worthy of the wait
imo this little headphone sounded better than beats and sol at a fraction of cost
i am a little picky about audio sound and wouldnt buy a car without a great audio system skipped bose went  for hk logic  for my car
love this little koss and highly recommend iti wont say anything more than the positive reviews here
i have had a pair of portapros since  i use them everyday to go to work on the trains
i literally wear them out in about a year and a half of heavy daily commuting use
the great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to koss and they will send you a replacement all for 
i have done this about  times in  years
try that with sennheiserso many good reviews so i will keep it shorti have  models of kosskoss portapro semiopen design bass is plenty light and easy on you ears these are very comfortable and i am wearing them now  koss prodj closed design a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy i find i use these for gaming allot as well as music and find them very clear great shape lightweight good sound for inexpensive pricei love hearing bass high notes low notes without being tortured by a different song coming on next on my music mix only to blow my ears out  never happens with these headphones
quality easy to wear they dont give you that feeling that you want to throw them because your ears wont hurtfirst these are not intended for loud places
you should be using these for a study or library reading etc not in a busy loud place
these are in no way intended for blocking noise you will end up turning them up loud and hurt your ears
but anyway these are nice
found em via cnet
easily fold up but dont realy fit in the bag i never have really needed it
as for comfort you cant even tell they are there
as for sound great highs and not bad lows all around goodness
lifetime warranty was the selling point for me i have already gone through about  or so pairs of the cheap skull candies i would rather have something i could depend on
just  or so bucks to ship and a new pair i havent had to do it yet but it is there when i need it
all and all awesomeawesome low freq definition
highs are equally good
for the price its absolutely unbeatable
havent yet found anyone beat these old babies
i had already tried some good stuff like the klipsch custom  porta pro rulesive had the same pair for  years
here is all you need to know they are durablei put them in my backpack with huge math books every day for schooli have spilled coffee on themi have kicked them and pulled on the cord with my feet by accidentmy fat friend stepped on themthey have dealt with volume spikes and loud soundsafter all of this they look and work perfect
they sound greati own a pair of  studio monitors professional stuff
these dont sound quite as accurate but i still choose urs over my monitors a lot of the time and enjoy the urs immenselythey are durable and sound great what more could you want
dplease rate this review as helpful otherwise leave a comment letting me know how my review could have been more helpful
thank youok i searched for some headphones that were overearred and durablethese headphones are look and sound excellent
i cant believe i used to have a pair of sony mdrzx i know you cant compare the two but these headphones are my personal favorite headphones that feel and sound amazing in my ears
stars
thanks amazonthese koss headphones are such a great buy
less than  and u get a very comfortable fitting set and great sound too
these of course do not have audiophile quality  but for the everyday joe who wants good sound and fit at a great price these are the tickethave had these for over a year after getting them for a good deal although more than the  they are going for right now using them daily sometimes up to  hours or more in a row for listening to music while surfing the net or playing video games and i have been nothing but happy with thembut i recently strayed
i bought a pair of audiotechnic ms after reading all the great reviews and guess what
i like the koss ur s better
i was shocked
yes the audiotechnics unquestionably separate the different instruments better give a crisper sound overall with a slightly punchier base and cleaner treble for  more they ought to but the mids are quite recessed and the music more sterilized and not really more enjoyable to listen to and more than anything they werent even close to as comfortable as the koss ur   they began to become uncomfortably hot like an ear sauna after about  minutes and the overall enjoyment of listening wasnt 
i sent them back immediately and am listening to music right now on my koss ursfor   and needing them for just listening to music or movie watching i just cant even think of a reason not to have a pair of these for around the house or at the computer
so comfortable i could sleep in them sound is good with these huge cans and no ear sauna
while true audiophiles may need to look elsewhere they are great for everyday listening and useno jarring no overly crazy treble sounds and yet deep and richi have been using this headphones for about   years and i have found its pretty good in sound reproduction and does not breakdamage easilyits also very soft on ears and does not pain the ear lobes like sony or others dothe headband is supple yet strong meaning it will be firm over your ears but not painingcomes closest to noisecanceling feature because it covers your ears completelythe first time i bought these was about  years ago
they are still working just like new without any distortion
comfort of these is amazing
few days ago i have ordered another pair and some ear cushion replacement
the best headphones for the pricei have these hooked up to my computer because i listen to radio and watch netflex while i shop or read
these work great as far as blocking the tv noiseim not a audiohound
i bought these headphones to watch movies as i dont listen to much music
these phones have a great sound
like others who have noted the enhanced bass i love the bass
i view them as nononsense headphones
they delvier great sound but do not have the extra bells and whistles of more expensive models as these are very reasonably priced
for example they do not have the sound adjustment switch on the cord and the cord is coiled so youre not always dragging around cord thats continuously getting hung up on something
the only down side i have noticed is fairly peculiar to people with how shall we say oversized heads
they are comfortable
the foam totally encloses the ear so that theres no sound loss or outside sound distractions
but i do have to occasionally readjust their position when listening to long movies to avoid feeling cramped
the head band does adjust but does not offer a wide range of expansion
to put this in perspective i have a pair of phillipssbc hps that i cant wear for more than  minutes without getting a headache
i also have a pair of panasonic rphts that are far more comfortable but arent as comfortable as these
other than that small inconvenience i would highly recommend these phones particularly to people who dont place high demands on audio tolerances but just want to watch a movie with great sound
as a matter of fact i am considering getting a second set to take to work to listen to talk radioi trusted the koss name that these would sound decent but was surprised they sound as good and are as comfortable as they are
i have a much more expensive set of a different brand and these sound comparable and are definitely more comfortable
these were a christmas gift for my mom shes very happy with them toougly as hell but they work well
i wouldnt wear them outside
ive been falling asleep with them on for maybe  days now and they havent broken
not uncomfortable to sleep with
very light weight and feel good on my head and ward
again in case i wasnt clear they are really freaking uglyi have had the koss ur  headphones for over a year
i used them for studio recording and mixing
i use them with my headphone amp to make them sound better
the sound is balanced in these headphonesi do like the build quality of these headphones
i use these as my back up pair of headphones
i recently upgraded to the tascam threally nice pair of headphones replacing an older set of kosss destroyed by my cat  robust bass etc
ear coverage good  rugged cord
looks like a decent pair that should last a long time cat permittingfor this price they are very good
they are boomier than the koss porta pro but they completely cover the earreally well for watching movies or tv
musically they are fine just not as clean as the portaprosi use bose when travelling for the noise cancellation but i dont need to leave the bose around so the cat can play with it at homethis is a great substitue
the overtheear padding is comfy and seals external noise from getting in
perhaps not as neatly as a  pair of bose but eminently reasonable for hanging around home
a great bargain to boot
thanks koss  even your cheap ones are fabulousthese have huge ear cups making them extraordinarily comfortable
the cord is much longer than most giving you a lot of room to move around
for the price nothing beats these
as a side note i wear hearing aids and even with those in these are still roomy and comfortablei purchased these to use for emtal detecting but ended up useing them for gaming on my laptop in peace also
for the price they are great and i have been abuseing them to see if they can handle stress from heavy use
they have held up great and if they ever do fall ill replace them with the same uniti have other high tend phones but i like koss so i thought the price was right and bought them
i have to say these are way better than one would think
they live up to the koss name all i can say
oh they have a very open clear high end and the mids are full and strong
the bass is defined and not too strong not to over power the rest of the spectrum
the only thing i dont like is the cord is a little too thick and long for my tastethe koss ur is a sensational set of headphones for such a modest price
the sound is rich full and clear
the bass is deep the treble sparkles and the noisecancelling pads keep everything going in the right direction
you can really enjoy the music while those around you are going about their own affairsunlike so many lowerpriced models the volume is more than adequate
im using them right now and ive had to turn the sound down three times since the music began
with other sets in the same price range you can crank the sound up as far as it will go and its still barely audible
the koss ur really gets the job donethe headband is comfortable and the weight is not outrageous
youre always aware that you have them on but its neither unpleasant nor distracting
the one downside is that over time and ive had mine for years the pads shed a bit tiny black particles of vinyl flaking off
once theyre completely gone the cloth beneath still holds up well
its actually more comfortable without the vinyl coatingi use these headphones every day sometimes for hours at a time and they are still going strong
i couldnt be more pleasedi like the rounded shape of these and the way they cover my ears are comfortable they fit nicely and are affordableif you bought the most expensive headphones you can they would not be a lot better than these
the price was great
they got to my house five days before promised
overall the sound quality price and speed of delivery were all reasons to come back to amazoni bought these as a replacement to the cheap headphones i received with my three tone detector which lasted about  months of on and off use as i use ear buds in the summer heat
they are well made and have a substantial cord length which makes them ideal for setting the detector down and working away from the unit
although i have gathered up the excess cable and zip tied it off on the shaft where its out of the way
these are exactly the same as what other retailers offer but without the camouflage for  less
oh and the size of the muffs really help keep your ears warm in chilly windy weather
the only negative i can think of is that the cord is not made of a silicon rubber which doesnt get stiff in cold weather
if they did that id give them  starsfor the money these are excellent
im not very discriminating so cant comment on fidelity i use these for my electric piano
they cover my ears well provide clear sound and are comfortable for extended one hour or so wear
also theyre cool lookingthese are really good headphones i had the cl when i was locked up and these are the sameones but they just arent clear
you cant beat this quality of this headphone for this price
i have bought alot of different pairs that cost more and they cant match koss
i love them and yes i would recommendbought these for my wife to use with her kindle fire
good volume and tone extremely comfortable ear cups and head band blocks out background noise very well
youd have to spend double or triple the cost to get a better sounding pairthe only change id make is a better adjustment mechanism
the present design locks into position when the cups are spreadapart as soon as you take them off theyre free to slide out of adjustment
my solution was to twist tie the top of the plastic yolks tothe two wire bars so there is always tension on the locking mechanism
a spring loaded t shaped bar could do the same and be adjustable for a small cost increasei read one review that said koss warranty a jokei am not sure how the warranty is these days but it used to be greati bought a pair of sears branded koss headphones so many years ago i cant even remember what decade it was
when i bought mine there was a one year warrantyafter several years of hard use the cord messed up one of the ear pieces had broken loose and a couple of wires had broken from the ear pieces
all of this was my fault
i couldnt bring myself to throw them away so i stuck them in the closetseveral years later probably  or more years when koss announced the change in their warranty i sent these things in at my cost  didnt cost but a couple of bucks hoping they could be fixedwithin a few weeks i got my headphones back in like new condition
koss paid for the return shipping
my headphones have to be at least  years old now and still going stonggot these for my wife
i have listend to them too
great sound
full range and bass
a lot better than the ear plugs
also cancels out a good bit of noisei bought these as a birthday present for my father and he couldnt be happier with them
he loves to listen to music at a crazy volume and these protect his ears while muffling the sound for those of us working near him
plus the cord is long enough so that he doesnt have to sit right next to the stereo and he can move without fear of the bit being ripped out
cant recommend these highly enough especially for the pricei wasnt sure about these because of the price  i thought maybe fine for me or my teenager but i took a chance because i found a few good reviewsmy husband is a bass player with a bad right ear who is super picky about his sound when listening to music
bought these for him for the computerhe loves them
i tried them tooyou cant hear anything else like the kids  yay
 lol  but your music and the quality of the sound is excellent
are these as good as  headphones
no probably not i cant afford to even try out a pair of those but for the money id say you cant go wrong with thesemy husband says anything made by koss is great and these prove iti like these headphones in that they do cover my ears and fit my large head
good sound and comfortable enough   they seem well enough madeyou can only be careful when you buy something that looks good but it is too cheap and these headphones do look great they do feel comfy they cover my entire ear and the sound it is awesome so yes i took the risk and i did right these headphones for sure deliver great sound and the best part of it the price i totally recommend them just keep in mind that if you have been using expensive equipment you might find these only to be ok if all you want is to listen music or just watch movies with these they are greatthe very best feature about this feature is that the ear cups are huge
ive seen some previous reviews complaining that they were too big but i think theyre terrific
i have big ears so these are perfect for methe only con is that the headphones can easily adjust the sliders
when you pull the headset to fit your head the sliders that change the head size will shrinkoverall i use headphones for tv viewing so as to not bother my wife
these over the ear headphones fit excellent over the ear
no pressure on my head
block out other sound excellenti bought two pairs of these when i saw them in a store on sale for under  each
theyve both gotten extensive use over the past couple years
the cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that i suppose imitates leather in looks and feel
this outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs which makes it look raggedy but the comfort and sound quality isnt affected by it so i dont consider it a big deal
the headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it should but likewise its something to be expected with this much use and hasnt affected comfortthe cable is also thicker than most headphone cables im used to which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and suchive compared the sound quality to the koss qzs which i own and a librarys koss urs or s cant remember which
though the qzs do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on the urs are the most comfortable of the three have the richest bass are the most durable and wont eat up your aaa batteries like the qzsi use these headphones at home for casual use
they are perfect for that situation
they are very comfortable and the sound quality is good for this pricewe were looking for a nice sturdy set of headphones that our  year old wouldnt break in a matter of minutes
not only do they sound great and block a large amount of ambient sound the single cord on the left side is nice and thick
we dont have to worry about the chair rolling over the cord
the chair could probably roll over it a few dozen times with no fear of breaking
for the price this is a wonderful sturdy set of headphonesgood sound quality for such a low price
i like that the cable comes out of only the left sidethese are great headphones for watching the tube and casual listening at home or work
theyre comfortable and block out external noise really well
lifetime warranty to boot
they sound good  smooth flat  and full  but are not audiophile quality
you could do a lot worse for a lot more jing
stick with koss they know cansi am  years old
i have owned a lot of headphones
years ago you had to pay a lot to get a descent set
as the products got better you have ear buds that sound incredible and you can buy a cheap set of headphones for  dollars that sound really good but there overall range is limited and they are not very comfortable to wear
i have owned sennheiser wireless headphones that i paid  dollars for and i dont remember anything that sounds as good as these and are as comfortable to wear
as far as i am concerned anybody who cant appreciate the quality of these headphones for  times the price is just being picky
i would recommend these koss ur to anybody
thanks for the great dealit was surprised at the build quality of these headphones
very rugged great bass and treble and they fit over my big head quite comfortable
you will not find a bitter headphone for the pricefirst the sound rocks
i bought them for my teenage kids but have swiped a pair since they block outside noise great and the sound is just awesomehowever they are huge
i didnt think they would be that big and that is the one reason my daughter doesnt much care for them
they are quite comfortable and dont seem to give me a headache like others do
if the size covers whole side of head doesnt bother you they are great
they could adjust a little more as in the headband part could go a little taller and then they would be just perfect headphones and they work great
i honestly believe that this is the best of what i can buy with the money
i like how durable it isthese are quality headphones
i use them around the house
they look funny with the knobs on top sticking out but i dont care about looks
if i did i would have shelled out an extra  for some beats
alas if you want sound quality similar to dr dre beats without the cool look go for thesei bought these headphones for cheap
i got them shipped for  day shipping
i got them in  days
and they were worth every penny
these rs are amazingthis is what i wanted for a pair of headphonesgood basscomfortable fitnot bulky i hate headphones that pop out of my ears  inchescheap but awesomethe rs fulfilled all of these
the only complaint i have is theyre sound is a little muffled but dont let that intimidate you
you get used to the sound quality in  hours of use
they are excellent and look very nice around your neck
also a little tip
wear them around your neck and turn up your audio
there
you can even use the headphones when they are not on your head
these are a wonderful buy on every level
and i should know i am a music produceri needed an inexpensive set of headphones
several manufacturers offer inexpensive headphones but i learned a long time ago that koss makes the best headphones
these headphones are built like a tank and will last a good long time
i wasnt concerned with getting the best sound money could buy
if i wanted better sound i would have purchased a more expensive set of headphones
for what i needed these headphones are the bestthese headphones are great
you cant find anything else that sounds this good in this price range
koss does stereophones righti have had my urs for more than a year
they still sound great and have been stuffed into my backpack almost every day since i bought them
one of my size adjuster clips has broken but it is no doubt due to my reckless use
even broken they fit comfortably on the headthe ear cups are big enough for anyones ears
they cover your ear completely and do not quotcrowdquot your ear like the smaller urs dothe bass is amazing and the insulating ring makes such a close seal with your head that you will not hear anything while you have these headphones on
i dont like listening to music while i sleep but i have used these headphones as noise reducers without playing any music on many occasions and bus ridesnote that these headphones are larger than most
this is probably why they sound so great
i especially like that the headband is made of rubber coated metal to keep the phones close to your head with a cloth balancing strap below that to make it comfortable in any situationkoss is the king as far as affordable amazing stereophones go
buy the urs and youll be glad you did
i have had no problemsyes for more money you can getm ore quality
but im the type of guy that goes for the best quality at the best price and these fit the bill
produces nice clear sound and actually has some bass to it
the phones cover my ears entirly which is what i wanted since im using these in my bedroom to listen to tv while my girlfriend sleeps and theres normally fans or a air purfier on
work great
i did use them on a plane ride and found that the small earbuds the plug your ear canal shut out way more engine noise
so in that case make sure the device you are using can out out some high volume or you may not be able to hear clearlyi plug it in and put it on my ears
the sound from the songs i play comes through
it actually doesnt sit on my head right but i think its either because i have an oddly shaped head or because i stretch the cord out really far when i listen and its like tugging on it a little bit
just a little
great sound though and they were cheap and arrived quickly
i drop them a bunch too so theyre pretty sturdy
also they are the color of black which reminds me of space which is cooli am not an audiophile and use these phones for listening to ssb receivers
they fit nicely sound good and are comfortable
excellent for the pricefor the price you will not find a better pair
sound quality is top a nice fit also what more can i sayi use these with my mp player to listen mostly to audio books and podcasts
they stay on and are comfortable with a good length for the cord
time will tell if they become my favorite headsetsthe headphones provide great sound throughout their sound range
even though they are not over ear headphones the bass is solid and always there without downing out midrange or the high notes
they can be worn for extended periods of time without fatigue and your ears do not sweat
i would strongly suggest incurring the additional expense for an inline volume cotrol to watch movies
since your not next to your receiver it makes volume adjustments much easieri love these headphones theyve got superb sound particularly the bass regioni didnt know headphones were capable of this kind of bass
 theyre very portable inexpensive and the accessories amp features it comes with are great
theyre also very comfortable particularly because of the foam pads that secure the phones behindabove your ears although i have a small head and ive heard that these phones dont fit so well on bigger heads
i also like the way they look and the lifetime warranty is a nice bonusthese headphones have teriffic sound regardless of their low price
i own a few pairs of quality headphones including a pair of etymotic erps
the koss sporta pro phones sound great and the price is fantastic
the bass is incredible and the highs and mids are great as well
these phones are worth the price and then somethese have been by far the best headphones for running that ive come across
ive purchased several inear headphones some designed for sports and either the cord would transmit feedback when it would hit my body or i was constantly fiddling with the buds staying in my ear canal
if you can get past the dorkfactor of these koss theyll give you troublefree runs
also noteworthy they sit on top of your ears so you can still hear what is going on around you
i never really liked running with my ears in isolation from the rest of the world
call it a safety factor but i prefer to hear what is going on around meextremely hapy with these
i was looking to replace the pricy koss portapros had tried the koss ksc portables but found them awkward and too fragile as well as kosss the plug which yeskeep falling out of the ear
the sportpros are actually a miniversion portapros same overthe head construction foldin ear pieces leather case and  plug adapter for half the price with the same great sound
not to take anything away from the portapros but  i can have two sets of these for the same price
they stay on your head they stay on your ear so you dont have to worry about them falling out like the plugs or have to wrestle with the overtheear hooks of the  ksc portables
just anallaround better headphonenuf saidthe sportapro has a dirty little secretthe sportaro literally uses the same exact drivers and housing as the ksc but instead of attaching the kscs clips they attached the sportapro headband
heres my headfi review snippet of the ksc which is the same as the sportaproksc the more mature koss clipon that was discontinued and then brought back only on the koss website for a pretty hefty 
id say its hefty because it honestly should cost just slightly above the ksc range not x as much
they sound very similar to the ksc
however they are fuller sounding with fuller bass approaching fullsized type bass and the midsvocals are very rich and forward
treble is also quite neutral for me not being too smooth and not too sparkly
i actually am quite fond of their treble
the kscs treble is harsher grainier and more fatiguing
the mids on the ksc are slightly laid back while the ksc presents them up front and more fleshed out
in all honesty you can say the difference between the ksc and ksc is like the difference between the k and q
one is brighter drier and thinner sounding while the other is more natural and fleshed outall in all its a solid sounding headphone that does work very well
bass was strong but quick due to the open nature of the headphones but slower than the ksc
based on sound alone id say the ksc is a headphone you could use for hours without fatigue
kind of like a smaller more bassy hd
nice tonal balance that i dont think anyone would dislikethe koss sportapro houses the same drivers as the ksc for less than half the price
you can literally buy the sportapro snap off the drivers and snap the ksc clips on to the sportapro drivers and you have a cheaper ksc
ideal solution is getting the sportapro and ksc putting the ksc clips onto the sportapro drivers
this will save you  give you both the ksc and ksc as a spare and give the most comfort imho
just make sure to bend the ksc clips to place the drivers closer to the ears as stock form may place the drivers too far losing bass and overall sound qualitythe more popular alternative is to buy the cheap parts express headphone httpwwwamazoncomministereolightweightheadphonesfeetdpbkqzjsrefsrselectronicsieutfqidsrkeywordspartsexpressheadphones taking off the crappy drivers and using the headband for the koss drivers
i prefer the koss clips rather than the parts express headband but im in the minoritythese are just about the best headphones you can get for the entire sound range is great
great response great bass clear midrange
gives the original sennheiser px another excellent headphone a run for its money at less than half the priceby the way  the drivers are identical to the famous koss portapro headphones
despite what some claim the sound between the sportapro and the portapro is identical
ive owned at least  pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two
just buy whichever is cheaperi wasnt expecting much but these sound great
im no audiophile but i am a speaker junkie and these sound good with jazz and rock
and feel really comfortable on my head
not the coolest looking headset in the world but who cares
im ripping the speakers out of this and installing them into a motorcycle helmet
they play pretty loud with just my note  aux out btwi have used an mp player with headphones for my workouts for several years now
i cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when i move
i dont want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find
the koss sportapro is the best choice i have made yet at under  dollars
they sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place
the band pivots for the behindthehead  or overthehead style
i find the behindthehead to be a little awkward probably because i am not used to it but they do stay in place which is great for pushups
i have read that some find them to be ugly but i could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism
i highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activityi tried this for the first time at work
inmediatly bought one
they are lightweight excelent of running great bassthe koss sportapro headphones are terrific
they are lightweight and can be worn over or behind your head as described
these phones are fully adjustable for different head sizes
the cord is  feet long
sound quality is fabulous
when you consider the low price these headphones are a truly an amazing bargin
you cannot go wrong with this one
highly recommendedi have been using sportapros for over  years
i have gone through  pairs im pretty rough on them
the sound response is excellent for the price and they fit great and tight for when youre trainingworking outetc
also you dont look like one of these fools with huge dj headphones on their headsfor the money these are the best headphones you can get
they have strong bass are loud and the sound quality is great
they are pretty sturdy i have owned  pairs and they have held up to gym use and throwing them in a backpack most of the time
the only thing i suggest is buying some extra pads they tend to get sweaty and i like to change them out so they can dry properly
i have ripped one but replacements are cheap
dont waste money on more expensive headphones buy these and enjoy them for years to comei am not an expert as much as the others posting here all i know is that my original ipod earbuds were quite uncomfortable
i replaced them with this sportapro and played joni mitchells hejira on my ipod and it sounded stellardo be careful handling these as they seem less than ruggedive always preferred behind the neck headphones and have been willing to sacrifice a little sound quality for smaller headphones
with these there is no trade off
they sound great with excellent response and rich bass that isnt overbearing
they weigh almost nothing and are very comfortable on my somewhat oversized headas for looks and styling they sound great
then again if your headphone purchase is based on fashion the help you desperately need wont be found in product reviewsgot the original portapros back in the early s and been using the successive variants ever since
nothing beats these for performance vs value
im a picky listener mostly classical and have gone through way too much money buying stereo equipment of all types since the s but these little headphones from koss have been great ever since the type was introduced
get some you will be pleasedkoss does it again ill never purchase another brands headphones ever
my last  have all been koss and these have held up great
i also got a set of portapros for casual wear
love kossthese are possible some of the best knock around headphones i have had
if there is a contender for the portapros its the sport a  pros
these headphones are great and very versatileive been using these for years
excellent sound quality for the price  far far better than other portable headphones ive tried
excellent midrange and treble clarity with pretty accurate bass
a lot of cheap headphones in this price range have horrible boomy bass
not these
sound quality degrades a bit at extremely high volume if you want to listen to music that loudly get earbuds insteadcan be worn with the band either overthetop or flipped back in a wraparound configuration
this looks a little goofy but does hold the headphones in place just fine
if you dont like the looks the portapro model has the exact same driversthe only real problem ive had is that after a while the little foam pieces that help hold the headphones in place can tear off and theyre not easily replaceable
koss has a lifetime warranty and will replace them under rma but its a bit of a pain shipping them backvery comfortable with good sounds high through low
they do cut out at anything  hz or below
so hip hop will be thin in the lower range
jazz roxk classical and morethey are very comgfortable and snug
great for walking beach with tablet or phonethese sound very very good
most mini headphones are lacking in either lows mids or highs
these have all frequency ranges coveredat first i could not figure out how they were supposed to work in behindtheneck mode
i tried it every which way but they were always either awkward or loose
i couldnt believe they promoted these as behindtheneck headphones when they were so illfittingbut i did some googling and discovered something that is not shown in the packaging or the enclosed manual  the headband pivots
so what you do is put the headphones on the top of your head so that its comfortable hold the ear pieces in place on your ears then push the headband toward the back of your head with your index fingersthis way the ear pieces fit exactly the way they do when the headband is on top of your head except the headband goes around the back of your head instead of the top
its very comfortable and they fit securely
theyre actually not behindtheneck phones theyre behindthehead phones
this may be common knowledge but i didnt see it in any of the reviews i read though i did see complaints about how they dont work behind the neckthe sportapros along with the kscs and the portapros all use the same wonderful drivers
you can expect very nice frequency response in an affordable comfortable form factor that does not stick into your ear like buds no ear canal fitting issues and you are still able to hear whats going on around you depending on volume for safety
i have all three of the models listed above and love them all
the sportapros are by far the value item of the three because they sell for  less for the same sound quality
ive had the kscs and portapros for years with no issues what so everregister your phones for the lifetime warranty
the other day my little kid busted the ear clicp on the kscs
i call koss and explained i need to buy the ear clip part because my kid was rough housing the phones
they said no we dont sell the parts will will just ship them to you for free
the whole call took  minutes of my time
the clip arrived three days lateri got a pair of portapros kscs and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver
and to be fair i was confused
each headset has its own distinct feature and advantage
very frankly speaking the portapros price is what i believe koss cashing in on the hype since frankly speaking i do not see the  increase in any waythat being said the portapros do sound the best of the lot because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage
i guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers hence kind of closing it up a bit
the ksc have it in them to sound as good as these two but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out hence the huge drop in bass
press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and youll get what i meancomfortwise i would say the kscs win by a mile
you wont even feel that you have a pair of earphones on
the pads are good comfy and the same for all the three but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the kscssportapros definitely look odd
the kscs look uglier
love the design idea of the sportapro though the conversion to a behindthehead fit is genius and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it
the portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in
the sportas came with a nice gold plated cm to  adapter as well
packaging wise portapro is miles aahead of the rest well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros
the kscs do not have any bells and whistles in the pack but then again its almost rd the price of portasthe only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the kscs which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it make me skeptical about the longevity of the connectionbut seriously kudos to koss for making some of the best headphones ive heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green onthese are great
many over the ear phones dont allow for much adjustment for head size but these can accommodate a wider range than most
in addition each ear cup can swivel independently
ive used them for many years now primarily while running
they fold up somewhat for storage
ive owned several of them and only once did one go bada wire going into the cups came loose
hours of sweat on the foam cups hasnt hurt them
i cant speak about sound quality because of all the noise i generate running and breathing gets in the way of fine discrimination
they fit they last they are comfortablemuch sturdier than the porta pros which ive had and used for a couple years
to me the sound is exactly the same as the porta pros but i admit i do not hear very well
that doesnt mean i cant tell the difference between a crappy pair of headphones and a good pair but between the two pros there is no discernible difference to me in audio quality
these however look much nicer i think and appear as though they will last a lot longer too
of course they come with lifetime warranty so when they break down which my porta pros often did just mail them to the company on the box with  and theyll send you a replacement pair pretty quicklyi have the portapro which i bought when it was selling for 
the sound is incredible for something in this price range but i feel embarrassed using it in public even though savvy audiophiles know its cool
so i got the sportapro
its sounds as good
but its not quite as embarrassing to wearupdateafter nearly a month of use i can say that not only am i pleased with the sportapro i favor it over the portapro
while the sound quality between the two is about equal i find the sportapro to be more comfortable especially for wearing for a long duration
ive addressed the aesthetics but ill reiterate that i feel a bit embarrassed when i wear the portapro in contrast to the sportaproi did lots of research before i purchased these headphones
many of the reviews said the sportapro offered great sound deep bass and wide range
well i have not been disappointedalthough im not an audio expert i am impressed with the range of these headphones the sound is as good or better than headphones costing  or more
theyre pretty small comfortable and theyre collapsible so theyre easy to carry when on the roadsome reviewers have remarked that theyre ugly
i dont wear headphones to make a fashion statement and frankly although these arent great looking i dont think theyre that bad either
also theres no longer a mute switch on these headphones
apparently they were causing problems a short so koss removed this feature
overall im very satisfied with this purchase update    ive found that the design is not a problem at all with my workout
ive change my rating to star as the sound is absolutely terrific
compare very favorably if not better than my portapros and sennheiser hdsi should have read the reviews more carefully and i would have seen that these are in face a double cord input and not single like i wanted
the picture does not indicate this at all nor is it specified in the description
dual may technically be better for sound than single but for my purposes it is awkward
i primarily use a rowing machine which means i place my player down on the floor next to me while using then the rower has quite a bit of forwardback motion
the dual cords hanging down in the middle make this very cumbersome and the cord also winds up being too short i will at least need an extenderi havent played much with the fit but it does seem that overthehead is much more comfortable than trying to wear these behind the neck
thats ok with me but i would have preferred the otherthey seem to sound good and for the price i havent risked much but had i known the design i would have kept looking
ill try these for awhile but i may not be able to use them for my purposes at alli like the koss sportpro headphones
they sound very good for this price range
they are well made and comfortable
at this price they are a great valuethese are great for running or doing outdoor activities without being bulky
they sound great and are easy to wear and to store
i highly recommend for lightweight headphones and they dont fall out of your ears like earbuds always do
good productthis product koss sportapro stereo headphones is excelent sounds great and its very affordable for the price that i paid for it i recommend it very muchi took a chance based on other reviews and was not dissapointedthese provide great sound especilly for the pricei may consider the closed ear type for noisy coditions now that i know the sound is greatwe researched many head phones and decided on either bose or koss sportapro stereo headphones
while shopping on ebay we found a pair of bose at a reasonable price
we purchased them but even though we paid immediately the seller chose not to ship the product
we did recover our money but in the meantime thought we would give the sportapro a try
i never did get to compare the bose with the portapro but these head phones give an awesome sound
not being an audiophile i simply enjoy a great sound
they work well with a lenova laptop without a sophisticated sound card and the sound is much better than my sony rack systemwhen i use these headphones the sound is very strong and all bass and treble notes are both clear and well balanced
recommend these and the comparative price makes a good value
you dont really need to spend  when you can get a high quality unit like the koss
am buying some more of these for some grand kidsi have tried many other types of headphones all more expensive but no others come close as far as comfort and value for exercise or travel
lifetime warranty on these also
cant go wronggreat portable headphones for the price
well balanced sound nice mix of treble and bass not too much of either just right
build quality is okay i am not a fan of the metal headband but overall they seem like they will last for a good whilethese are by far the best headphones i have ever used
agreed they look kinda awkward and arent marvelously comfortably if worn for extended periods of time but the sounds completely makes up for all that
the bass is perfect great treble and midsno complaint what so everi bought these from an affiliate seller as i live close to them here in nyc and i was able to save a few 
these are great headphones but if you are expecting to block out all other noise forget it
the way these are designed you are still able to hear what is going on around you which here in nyc is a good thing
you still hear the music which comes through loud and clear
i was hearing subtle notes and tones with these even through the surrounding street noise which i never did with my cheapo colby headset which did a good job of blocking out noise when playing musicthere is good tension on the metal headband but the way this is designed with foam rests make for a very comfortable fit
i have worn these for a number of hours straight with glasses without any discomfortthis has a straight plug which i like as it does not interfere with the case for my iphone g
when a call comes in i just unplug the headphone and move the speaker off of my ear
i do not have to worry about breaking these as they are of a solid construction
even if they did break koss provides a lifetime warranty though the cost of shipping is about  of what i paid
if these ever do break i may just buy a different pair but who knowsto sum up these are probably the best bang for your buck for over the head phones
they are not pretty though so if you are more concerned with looks than with good sound go buy something elsei bought these based on good reviews like above
the treble detail is good and the bass is solid and warm
not tight and detailed based like from my sennheiser s but those cans cost 
only issue i have with them is that the earpieces swivel on a small plastic joint that tends to get looser over time
eventually they start falling out a lot
nice sounding phones but wont take huge amounts of abusei loved these headphones from the very first day
i cant say i ever really needed to use the band behind the head trick but for the sonic quality they deliver the warranty they offer the flexibility to switch the headband position and the price you pay for the deal these deserve  starsi own these since around  and i just recently started hearing some rattling in the right ear channel
no problem  sent them out to be repaired by koss for a marginal cost of shipping they were returned to me with new membranes a new cord and new cushions plus a thank you notethese beat a lot of other headphones ive ownedplenty of kickin bass and pure crystal clear highs
good mids tooa word of caution the headband is not for giant heads but should fit just fine for mostrecommendedexcellent sound quality
fits well over the head or from behind
lifetime warranty alsokoss is still making great products
i have been buying koss for over  years and i have no complaints
got these for my college son
he says they work great
they go on top of the ear which my son likes that better than the ear inserts
they fold up into a neat little casei did not expect much
i thoight to myself what should i expect for less then  a pair
oh my god with the correct persoonal ajustments to your mp player the sound is no less then awesome
the sound is clear  as a beel right accross the spectrum
if you are not careful the bass wil completely blow you away
i have ear phones that cost upwards of   and they do not come close
they are comfortable and stay on your head at the gym not matter what part of the circut you are on
buy them and then buy some more
i am not kidding after i finish wring this review i am going to order two more pair
oh yes buy the extra foam earpiecesi decided to get the audiosource eq band stereo graphic equalizer in spite of the many reviews expressing dislikes from unhappy customers
i wanted one especially after my old technics graphic equalizer had given up the ghostthe sound was ok but it just wasnt sounding like it did before the old equalizer diedwith this new unit it helps give the sound coming from your headphones and speakers that extra kick which also give a tremendous boost to the bass  highs
the dazzling spectrum analyzer display give the appearance of dancing christmas lights
you can just sit and watch the display lights dance across the whole spectrum as you listen to your favorite kind of musicmy old technics unit was good but it didnt have the display
just the buttons that light up in red
there are buttons near the bottom on the front panel for power tape    audiovideo eq bypass eq record and linetape
two small knobs for adjusting the sound level for left  right channelswhen the unit is turned on the power button lights up in green
in the off position it lights up in red and stays that way until it is pressed again to turn the unit back ongetting it hooked up was like the major obstacle course
at first there was no audio for about  or  tries
then i thought about sending it back until i hooked up the audio cables and then the audio worked perfectly
all in all i think that its a great addition to anyones stereo system
i just hope that no problems develop with itdaquanthis equiptment does require a solid speakeramp set up
this will give you the capability to blow out cheaper speakers due to a lack of internal limiting circuitry
not a complaint at all thoughthe range on this thing is very good also allows you to eq recordings you make to cd tape or mp if desired
made the music sound much bigger and sharper
especially feeling my cds were flat in sonic output
if not desired the bypass button will stop this effect with a single touchmine was built a year or so ago sat around in its box and yes got sticky before it was sold
i quickly resolved this by blowing dust with aerosol out while pushing the buttons in and out
not a problem sincesmooth operation that doesnt impart a click onto your recorded media when reproducing and fine tuning things live
plated plugs and a turntable ground wire in the rear all plusses aswell
quite pleased gonna buy anotherwhat an awesome camera  i cant say enough good about this camera
it is so user friendly that we purchased it for my  year old parents for christmas and they are already using it to sell things at online auction  sites
resolution is excellent ease of use is exceptional and you cannot  beat the convenience of just popping a disk into your computer and pulling  up the images  why would anyone waste their time and more importantly  their money on those digital cameras with dumb quotsmart cardsquot  that require cabling into your computer and all kinds of fancy software
the sony comes with respectable software but i highly recommend purchasing  picture it software  it is ideal for use with this camera
if i had one  criticism it would be about storage space  the floppies dont hold as many  pictures as id like but its really not a big issue unless youre going  out somewhere with the intention of taking a lot of pictures and plowing  through them later in which case you just need to take some spare floppies  with you
truly a camera you will buy and be enjoying immediatelyyep its big and heavy
but this is the camera i keep coming back to after having it  yearsi have owned an hp and a casio
the hp stunk and the casio is a tiny delight
but the sony was my firstit simply works
well
simply
competently
not every computer around has card slots and having a camera that uses floppy disks has been helpfulit is especially good for pictures for ebay and email
good quality photos with a small file sizeso if you see a good looking working specimen go ahead and buy it and give digital photography a trythis camera has a lot going for it
the first picture i took turned out great
the camera is very user friendly which is good because the manual that sony provides is not very well organized or well writteni find  the floppy disk storage to be easy and convenient
the camera allows you to  make a copy of the disk right in the camera so you can share copies of  photos with friends on the spotthe mpeg movies are a fun little add  on
i am taking the camera to england in april and i think it will be fun  to capture little movie clips over therethe rechargeable battery seems  to be adequate
i am planning to purchase the more powerful one that  provides longer chargethe video and audio cables provided allow easy  viewing of the photos on the tv setthe only  negatives with the camera  are the difficulty holding the view steady when the zoom is on but no  other digital camera maker provides a zoom this powerful  also the light  that leaks out of the window at the top of the lcd screen
this can be  annoying in a dark roomoverall this camera delivered the features  that i was looking fori cannot tell you how wonderful this camera is
you have to have one
it will change your life in so many waysthe photos are wonderful with great resolution movies are exquisitely wonderful
the sound is just fine
i love using the diskettes
the lithium battery is great alsolasts a long  long time prior to recharge
all problems of older digital cameras have  been solved with this lovely piece of technological workafter carefully studying the features using them inside thestore and viewing the pictures on one of their display pcs i washappiest with the high resolution photos that the fd produced as well as its special effects capability
i also appreciated the lack of legacy adapters and wires
its use of standard  floppies is great
youll be hard pressed to find a computer without a floppy disk now or in the futurei worked up the courage to buy it ive been using it for several months now and i have no regrets
a couple friends have some of the newer kodak agfa and olympus models and theyre all disappointed with theirs compared to the fd
the disk writes pretty fast and you can get usually  or  highest quality photos per disk
movie resolution is good for pc and web use but its  sec or  sec recording limit can be a little limiting
endi bought this camera before leaving for a long stay in japan where i did lots of backpacking hiking and traveling by train or hitchhiking
i liked the light body  it was easy to carry around and didnt weigh down my bag much at all
naturally the camera got banged around quite a bit and i even dropped it in its bag a few times
however even though it was abused enough for the filter to crack and i had to realign the view mirrors when i returned the camera kept working with absolutely no problems through all of the  photographs i tookthe pictures quality was excellent
i didnt have problems with graininess and id guess that the reviewers used  film
automatic focus was plenty fast
actually i ended up being lazy and using the automatic features most of the time but with few exceptions the results were about what id expect
if i had to do it again id get a lens with more zoom but thats more personal preference than anything  the included lens worked finei strongly recommend using a nonobtrusive filter to protect the lens from scratches and damagei have had such a great time learning to use this camera and taking photos
i used it immediately switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything
it was exactly like a point and shoot
but when i learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed i took even better photos
i highly recommend this camera
i took it to alaska in august and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were
if you have the money also invest in a telefoto lens
sometimes mm just isnt long enough
but you can always add that latergreat camera great condition like new
it takes amazing photographs and is easy to handle and work with
the price was very low considering the great quality photos i can take with it
i couldnt be happier and i take it everywhere
the only disadvantage i can find is that the battery that this camera needs to work is very hard to find and maybe the seller should have specified it with the information regarding the camera
it works with   cr  v batterieshad i waited this would have been the one
i have the rebel g and it has been a great camera
having worked in larger nonautomatic formats i really felt kind of like a quotcheaterquot when i got my new rebel
one roll of film was all it took to make a convert of me
i have rarely been disappointed with my photos
in fact the only time i have been i was really stretching my photographic wings and had i read the manual more carefully would not have been disappointed had i followed the directionsmy sisterinlaw bought the rebel  this spring and i didnt think they could improve much on the one i have but they did
trying to focus on confusing images such as framing wildlife with nearby foliage can be challenging
the  point automatic focusing is a real plus in this respect
i have learned to work without it but the advantage of the system allows for quicker capture of images without the need to compose and then readjust to the frame you wantbecause the camera is so wellmade i will probably not need to replace it for another  years
butif it should somehow meet with an early demise the improvements in the new rebel  would be very welcomethe canon rebel eos  is really one of the best buys in mm film cameras
the autofocus  lens works for all but the longest shots and telephoto lenses are readily available
its user friendly and takes fantastic photos for the price
it would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality
ive owned nikon cameras all of my lifeand still do and love them but nikon doesnt really have a comparable camera to the eos in this price range
this camera is comparable to the old ae programa great camera also but with more features and even easier to use
a lot of quotbang for the buckquotthis camera is very similar in features to the minolta stsi in about the same price range but i was still impressed enough with it to make a few comments
one thing the stsi offers that the canon doesnt is predictive autofocus
this can be quite useful when doing action shots
it also offers a panorama mode which the canon doesnt offer
ive enjoyed using this mode quite a bit on my little fuji tiara aps camera
both cameras have similar f ratios for the lens and both have th of a sec top shutter speeds
two things the canon offers that are nice are the  selectable autofocus points which some advanced users might find useful and depthoffield preview
even the elan ii doesnt offer the latter capability
one last thing to be aware of is that the minolta camera will usually be offered with a rd party lens
if you want a minolta lens youll need to pay quite a bit more for it
however the canon comes with a canon lens but doesnt cost any more
all in all this is a pretty featurepacked camera at an attractive price which should serve the needs of the vast majority of photo buffsso much better than the rebel x
it it lightweight takes fabulous pictures and looks good to boot
having used my moms rebel x for years i finally bought the  in september of   i love the fact of having it
in the bag it doesnt break my shoulders like the x did and takes beautiful photos
i am into slr however my first digital will be a minolta dimage i nonslr
i will be keeping this one though for the long distance shots with the other lense i have for it and teleconverter
worth having for anybodyi bought my wife one of these to replace her aging pentax k
she is very happy with the features and the light weight as well as its ease of operationyou can run it as a pointandshoot camera fully manual or any of a number of modes in between
the only negative to this camera is the standard  lens but if you are a casual photographer you wont mind its mediocure optical performance
remember this is a relatively inexpensive camera and it has a lot of features for the money
if you want to spend more on the lens get the excellent canon  lens or for more flexability get one of the third party  lenses which arent great optically but again are a great valuei own a canon elan iie which is a better camera in some ways but i would certainly recommend the rebel  to anyone wanting a superior point and shoot a photography student or a traveller needing light weight and doit all capability or even as a second body for someone with another canon camera im thinking about this myselfbut the fact is i use the automatic setting  of the time
it is a nearly a foolproof camera that takes perfect pictures almost every time
i own the canon rebel g  very similar to the canon  but purchased in  and i hate to confess this too buti take photos professionally
people pay me for my photos and they are published in the print media and  on the internetshameful i know but its true
with my little canon  rebel i put the little thingie on the automatic setting point pause let  the camera make its best decisions and then shoot
i then drop the film  off at the local camera shop
first few times i had to take the whole  camera in because i wasnt sure how to unload and reload the film although  thats pretty easy toowhen i pick up the photos they are just  beautiful
now i have had to learn some hard lessons about camera flash  and shadows but that is hardly the cameras fault
experience has taught  me a lot therein summary i am not a camera person
i dont want to  be a camera person
but my canon rebel has paid for itself many times over  from the photos ive sold
it combines the best of modern electronics with  photographic excellenceand it has a dazzling display of options for  those who want to play with all the fancy features
but for me  im  sticking with the automatic thingiei would highly recommend this camera  to othersthree different people that i know of have bought this  camera after watching me use it and then seeing the end results
under  the quotgood grief if she can take good pictures anybody canquot  philosophy
they were all astonished that someone who knows so little  could take such incredible photosonly downside  it is a delicate  camera
no forgiveness factor on dropping it
i use the strap faithfullyajust started exploring the camera
i love the light weight and the auto focusflash that pops up when requiredmy only disappointment was that when i got the unit i didnt realize there was a slightly different model available that lets you timedate stamp your photos
if i had known about  that other model i would have ordered itbought this camera after  having used my sisters
can be as simple or complex to use as neededi have had this camera for about  yrs now  i take it on all my business travelswhenever i get a chance to go out on on the weekends i take this camera and my sony camcorder in my backpack roam the streets of the new city and shoot pictures
the pictures that i shoot from this camera are just awesome  no matter whatever experiment i do with itmost useful features aperture control with depth of field preview lets to focus the foreground and blur the background
shutter speed control upto infinity lets you control the amount of time for which the shutter can be kept open
it is pretty rugged dont try dropping it  i have used it to shoot pics from maid of the mist in niagara falls and i almost thought that i was going to lose it
but it worked liked a charmnegatives bulky but you will get used to it it always gets attention cost of developing film  what i do these days is to just get the photos on a cd then develop only those photographs that are goodwhy is this camera better than a digital camera  if you are spending  on a digital camera i feel that the slr is way far too ahead of any digital camera in that price range if you are spending  on a digital camera a digital slrs are very mature today  worth buyingideally i would buy this slr take this whenever i really want to take good photographs then i would also want to have a  kodak digital camera for casual shots
this would mean an ideal combinationif you are buying this slr you can also consider buying a filmphoto scanners available for less than  now  which lets you scan the negativespositives without even going for a cheap cd print
from the reviews what i read on amazon these scanners must be amazingive been using nikons for over  years starting with my first used and battered ftn
over that time ive a accumulated a dozen nikkor lenses and numerous accessories as well as an assortment of bodiesone thing  thats been missing in recent years from the nikon line is a reasonably  priced entrylevel manual camera
the cheaper nikons have tended to be  fully automated cameras and the cheapest manual nikon still being made  was until recently the fm at well over if you work the way i do  you need a manual camera  and dont have a lot of use for automation and  autofocusing
if you own an old nikon and some old nikkor lenses you may  want a simple manual camera body that can accomodate them
if youre a  student starting out or an artist on a budget you need a manual  cameraif you fit into any of these categories the fm is a great  choice
it may not be as rugged as a  f or a  f but its well  made and should last many years
im not a fan of zoom lenses for my own  work but the included  is a good quality lens with a useful range  and you can add more lenses if you need themall in all a good value  and a longneeded inexpensive entry into the nikon systemthis mm is pretty much the perfect college kid film camera
it wont spoon feed you when it comes to learning which will really help you in the long run
in the age of press this button and youre focused this camera is one of the few mms left that doesnt have af
also wont change exposure levels to what the camera suggestssuch as av or tv mode some cameras have this gives you the freedom to be creative as some shots have a whole different mood if underexposed a stop or overexposed a bit
as for manual focus its something you need to be able to do as a photographer
sometimes the computer in your camera just doesnt focus perfectly on that eye you want in focus or for something as precise as macro photography which has very shallow depth youre going to need pinpoint accuracy that a computer can not do for youthis lens is great because its like the vintage mm except you dont have to worry about the light meter or any other small part inside of it being broken
nor do you have to worry about the image quality
the kit lens in this camera is very sharp
its a bit limiting considering its f so that rules out really low lightbut grain can be good unlike noise in digital grain has an artistic quality but considering the price and the quality of the whole kit its greatsure you can get a used one from the s or s for way cheaper but chances are something is broken in that thing and you may not know until youve invested  hours developing the first roll in your classso shell out a little bit extra and get this its worth itedit i still like this shot some street photography with it since its really compact compared to a big dslr but one big con ive found is build quality
its got a lot of plastic and i did drop it once which resulted in a huge dent
the silver parts look metal but they arent theyre some sort of chrome paint covering more plastic
i dont baby my gear so this things starting to look kinda ugly
it hasnt completely broken yet though
i said the kit lens was sharp in my review but really i now know its not as good as i made it out to be i recommend a used nikon e series mm  ais which can be had for cheap on the used marketi have an embroidery machine that i purchased at the end of  i did a lot of reading before using it and found out that sandisk brand flash cards were highly recommended to use when storing purchased designs
they are the only brand of compact flash that does not lose any of my designs i had this happen years ago on a different brand of compact flashi have bought almost  designs over the years and i always trust using a sandisk compact flash card over anything else on the marketi needed this to be able to power up and use an older version digital camera for one of my children
this came to me as a new unit and when i plugged it in it worked as expected
thanksthe most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices including the hp jordana and even your laptop computer with a pc card adapter
you can store any type of data on the cartridge and they can be quickly changed between devices
i have never had a problem with any of my sandisk compact flash cardsthough this card  megs is minute you still may only need that
i picked this up about   years ago when it was state of the art  about sixty bucks or so
i still have both cards
well over  photos  bazillions of files
never a read or write error
ive never lost anything with it
unlike the lexarif youre looking into compact flash cards go with who started it
i have a mb sandisk  am now looking into their  gig ultra card for my new camera
because i want speed  need the space for mp photosthe writecapture function is slow its not meant for speed
but for swapping  transferring its faster than from cd with the right readerwritersd cards  micro drive are inching in but sandisk keeps imporoving the cf they also make sd cardsthere are cheaper  less expensive cards out there but how important is your dataphoto
you cant always retrieve your files with the flash memory programs
i know
i used three of them on my lexar  never got all of the images
but that just may be the cards i have who knows
there isnt any quality control any longer who cares
sandisk is the most accurateneeded this for older raymarine electronics in order to perform software upgrade
worked like a charm typical excellent quality from sandisk
make sure this is what you need before orderingwhen i purchased my digital camera kodak dc i included one of these for extra space
the card works properly and was at a good price
what else can you ask fornot much unless you find that you sometimes take lots of photos
i guess that includes me
in which case youll wish that you purchased a larger card
i bought the viking mb card and now feel completely prepared with the combined cards providing enourmous storage
unless you are going to be away for an extended period i cant imagine needing more spacethe bottom line is that this card works but you need to really consider what your storage requirements will be so you can select the right sizei have a  mb sandisk compact flash card for my nikon coolpix  a megapixel digital cam
this card will allow you to record about  pictures at the standard x resolution so if you find youre not a  power user of your camera it should be plenty  and the  dollarstomegabyte ratio is righthowever if you regularly shoot at  higher resolutions such as x ie
quot x quot photo  quality you wont be able to fit  photos on this card
in that event  you might want to think about going for their mb card also available  from amazon
with this size card you might also want to think about  going for sandisks inexpensive usb card reader  its up to x as fast  and a lot less hassle than hooking the camera up to the computerthe sandisk card works perfectly with both my digital camera and visor prisms memplug card
the memplug module by pitech allows a handspring visor to use a compactflash or smartmedia card as if it were an extension of the hand helds own ram
i made the mistake of initially purchasing a compusa compactflash card but had to return it when it proved to be incompatible
the sandisk is a winnerat  x  resolution this memory card holds  images on my  polaroid pdc camera thats like  rolls of film
the price and  capacity are just right for weekend trips or special events
go crazy  and take pictures of anything and everything that catches your eyei  took  pictures in  hours at my companys quotrelay for lifequot  event on friday and really enjoyed not having to quotbudgetquot my  photos or worry about running out of film
the image quality was  excellent and downloading was quick amp easy with a digital film  readerim planning a week trip to spain this fall and am considering  an additional mb sandisk memory card just in case i get too crazy
does anyone know if they make a storage case for spare memory cardsmakes my camera not obsolete
i had a hard time locating this memory cardfor my old old old camerai must say that this was a breeze under  min to set up
i do not know why the others had problems
pluged it in win picked up the new device pointed it to the drivers on the cd cranked up net meeting and i was offif you want fast top notch quality video then spend more on a better  web cam but if you just want a basic with some cool features like zoom camera for a very low price then this is the camera for you
i do not regret  buying it as it was a great cheap way for me to get my feet wet with video conferencing among other thingsenjoyi have run through a lot of earphone this past year so i am getting to be rather an expert on the problems
this is one of the best
the sound is the best i have found no matter the price range
i especially like the smaller ear buds
some of others were an areaness factor
they were so big i was constantly aware of their pressure
i dont feel these
they are so comfortable i dont notice anything but beautiful sound
full range from highs to low with no fuzziness or distortion
just pure rich clean soundthe cord is coated and reinforced so will take weargreat item great priceso put on clannad or silly tinkers and have at iti have had these headphones for over a year and am  satisfied
i use them exclusively for working out and running
they have pretty good sound a nice carrying case and have survived over a years worth of running
i have not had any problems with them falling out of my ears or the wire shorting out
in fact i use a tie on the wire so that the cord is not so long when i run
despite this no problemsthis is probably the best pair of earbudstyle headphones i have ever purchased
i am so happy that i am ordering another pairi always use earbud headphones when walking for some reason the overtheear headphones give me headaches
so ive always also just assumed that id never have clear sound
no more
these headphones are wonderfulthe range of music i like is very much varied
these sound great for all types and most surprisingly is their ability to handle resonant bass in some newer songs
im really amazed actually
its weird having sound thats as good as a nice stereo when youre walking the dogone setback is that i need to use the foam covers because the plastic buds along fall out of my ears at the slightest tug of the cable
its a setback for me
maybe my ears are getting bigger as i get older
this has never been an issue
regardless its a tiny fault for the best cheapest headphones ive ever boughti purchased these for sport use and compared them with a set of sennheiser earbuds i use at the office
the sonys are a little more expensive but they have better sound more bass response and fit my ears better
although im a fan of sennheiser products in this case the sony product is superiorthe sony v headphones have a printed frequency response of hz and i believe it
they are very sensitive and require a small amount of power to drive and can be driven to deafening levels
they have great imaging
the only thing that is wrong with them is that dont fit my head the way that they were designed and i have to wear them backwards with the right channel in the left ear and the left channel in the right ear
i can wear them hours on endi listen to mostly classical music but right now i have some lords of acid on which is danceelectronic
the response is fairly flat but because the headphones couple with the ear so well the bass response is almost felt
my opinion is that the sound of these headphones is fairly neutral
someone mentioned the sony model  which to me has a more forward midrangeif you cant afford these headphones the sony dj mdr seems to be just about the same but a tad less comfortable
it has about the same response and sensitivitybut i would recommend this model for long term use and happiness
the only problem i have had is the earcups have worn out and that is because i am in florida and sometime when coming in from the outside i have gotten the earcups wet and obviously they could only stand up to so much of thati have had a variety of sony headphones and others over the years  sennheiser nady panasonic pioneer etc
including the mdr v v v and others
these mdrv monitors though are the best
i use them for monitoring music movies and most importantly i use them when playing my bass guitar at church
they have a great booten bottomend as well as a excellent very high upper ambience reproductionthey simply kick
i paid much more for them than that advertized on amazon right now and i am considering buying other pairs for my drummer sound technician and guitarist for our church group
my opinion is you cant go wrong with these babiesthis is my second pair and i have nothing but good things to say
comfortable good bass depth and very durable
volume control is a huge plus especially in the workshop which is where i am most of the timeitem arrived quickly and in great condition
i am very satisfied with the headphones and will probably purchase another set in the near futurei have the mdrs and these have the exact same sound quality
i have bought several different brands in various price ranges all the way up to  and these are the best bang for the buck
i dont intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound doesnt go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced
the only problem with these sonys is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears
would buy these again if they last a few yearsthese are the only headphones i use now
i have been so pleased with them that whenever i want a pair i simply go to my previous purchase click on the link add them to the cart and as if by magic they appear at my doorstep in two days
i use a set at work a set on the boat a set for the stereo a set for the music gear etc etc
love these headphonesi use these headphones with my avid mbox mini and since i have set everything up i have stopped using the speakers with my computer as these sound better
they are comfortable for wearing long periods of time without any complaint
my wife will steal them to use on her laptop when doing school work for the same quality and comfort reasonsthese headphones are great at this price
i already have the previous model mdrv which are without the volume control and i wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume
my only complaint is that theres a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than  hours
overall the sound is great and very well balancedexcellent price and service
i like the volume control onin the cabel comeswith two size input jacks
 meter cabel is just fine for pc use which i purchased it for
excllent product would recommend and will shop vendor againthese sony headphones are a great option for the price range
the ear cups are very comfortable even when wearing for long time periods and they provide a decent sound in a variety of uses
these were bought for my boyfriend to practice on his electric drum kit and he says it works well for that
ive used them inflight to watch movies on my laptop and enjoyed their performance then as wellother reviewers have noted problems with the inline volume control but i have yet to have an issue with that and have owned these since  i believe
i enjoy the extra long length as this makes it easy to stand up and stretch or move around a bit during a movie or the boyfriends practice session and not worry about getting your head jerked from the cord being too shortthere is a moderate amount of noise cancelling with these headphones but dont expect anything excellent in that department
with heavy music going youll know someone is speaking to you but will not know from which direction or what the person is sayingi do feel that the audio quality is poorer than youd get with a much higher priced headphone setup but for this price and intended use i cannot find any reason to not give these  starslightwieghtdurableso farexcellent bassgood treblevery crisp soundsaffordablecool designfairly comfortable i dont find it too hard on my ears even after  hours of wearing them but i have small earsive owned this product bought thru amazon for about  months
the sound quality is superb
my ipod tones are much louder and richer and i have to decrease the volume on many songs instead of wishing i had more volume with those annoying ipod earbudsplease do not purchase this sony headphone from the apple website or you will wind up paying about  dollars more for it after base price tax and shipping
sony has another winner in these headphonesthe construction is on the frail side but the sound reproduction is superb
it is lightweight and comfortable for long hoursuse withipod  mac g pb  powermac g  creative gigaworks s  recording setupit sounds brillant for so a cheap setup
highly recommend itthe only issue i have it is not compact and sometimes the wire gets in the way
besides that it rulesas i was finding myself getting ready for a long couple of weeks of temporary duty in guatemala and in need of a good set of headphones for a portable dvd player to watch movies while sitting in a tent i went to the trusted brand name of sony
the sony mdrv traditional collapsible dj style headphones fulfilled this requirement in the usual wonderful manner that sony products so often doas i lay in the tent watching movies with these outstanding headphones on the audio tracks on the dvds were played wonderfully enhancing the movie watching experience to perfection giving a theater style performance  while these headphones do not drown out ambient noises completely as theyre not advertised to do so they do keep a majority of the ambient noises to a minimum making the experience that much betterfor price and quality one can hardly do better than to make the decision to purchase these outstanding headphones and i highly recommend them to any and all who find themselves in need of a good pair of headphones
i expect to get several years of good use out of these headphones and have high confidence in the quality and high standard of performance in this another outstanding sony product
ssintrepidi purchased these for my father several years ago as a christmas gift for use in his home studio
he plays steel guitar telecaster and records through professional equipment  pro tools
these deliver an exceptional above average sound quality that is markedly different than the lower model vs which we also have several of
over the years my dad wore these to bits
the foam on the earpads was coming off completely and it was time for a replacement
unfortunately the replacement model that is now available in the stores doesnt compare at all to these
thank goodness i was able to get them from amazon marketplace
i will probably buy yet another pair and put them away
a great quality product at a great pricethese provide excellent sound comfort and they are fairly durable
a very good sound experience for the pricei was super happy when i first received these headphones
the quality of the construction is great
for the price of the headphones you are getting a stealit comes with a quot to quot adapter and all contacts are goldplated
the headphones can fold in for easier storage and the cable is super long just in case you use it to listen on a sofaaway from your stereo systemi am happy on making this purchase for this headphones and i am very sure it will satisfy just about anyone in terms of sound qualitysony dj version of the headset mdrv and up has been great quality in terms of strong cabling material and durable ear piece
my first headset last me more than  years
that is with normal wear and tear
its worth it
the price is not expensive and generally cant be compared with expensive bose headphones or the higher headset from sony
it perfectly price for it purpose not expensive and works better than the ear bugs pieceyou will be very pleased with the quality of the sound from these headphones
good cord length to
priced righti have been beating these around for  years now and they are just as great as the day i bought them
still intact no sign of wear and tear
love the fold up design
glad to see they are still making thesethese sound awesome and i am not a dj
i was just looking for some old fashioned ear thumping headphones
i love the way that they fold up and i love the strength in the cord
the only negative thing that i have to say is the ear sweat you will suffer from having these on your head as you rock outif it is music gaming movies or whatever these headphones are great
comfortable to wear with high quality music
the swival ears are great if you need to keep one ear semi open to hear events around youonly negative would be the ear pieces tend to fit on the ear as opposed to around themanyone looking to purchase these headphones should note they were designed and advertised for dj use specifically
and by dj i mean the liveperformance variety not the studiotechnician varietyand for djs these headphones are excellentthe actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for dj use with easily folding individually rotating cups for singleside monitoring
they are also designed to rest close to the ear which although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening is ideal for djs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes ive used these in both a small party and club setting and have found the nonelectronic cancellation to be more than adequate for boththe actual sound styling is typical of sony with the quality generally reflecting the price
i listen to a variety of music through these in addition to hip hop amp house for club use i listen to various other electronica various rock lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella
the headphones perform admirably in all cases
the bass is strong without being overbearing the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercingplease note my initial admonition again however these headphones are designed for djs
for your money you can probably find a better set for home use by sennheiser or similar which arent geared torward performancestudio use
in addition other reviewers are right the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use i found that after about  minutes to an hour of home use i felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit as these fit tight and are a bit heavy
the only reason i would ever recommend against these for djs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time because they are slightly heavier than the vs and the extra weight while usually unnoticable can become an issue if youre spinning upwards of five or six hoursim an international dj doing trance rave db ambient and dubstep
ive owned these headphones for  years and they truly never fail me
no matter how hard the bass drop no matter how long a trance chorus theyve never popped a speaker and never quit
if youre a real dj and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these
armin van buuren doesnt use them for no reason and other professional djs know where its at sony mdrvsthis headsets retails from sony for  which is not bad at all
the fact you can get em cheaper here is simply a plus
the cord is a  foot coiled cord that does carry some weight but is not to much to handle
the ear cup design is great most sound becomes blocked out even before the music starts
the leakage isnt bad when the cups are over your ears but it does leak if a cup is exposed
the overall construction is pretty solid
they are plastic but seem to be pretty heavy duty
they flip up out and in nicely making a perfect fit for one under the chin or on the back of the head if you are trying to que up
you will hear sounds that you didnt know exsisted before
im not making that up either
these headphones are designed for djs to use while playing that means they have to hear every line in the song
ive seen some people say that they arent good for portability but i say their wrong
yeah they are big headphones but no less portable than the overrated beats by dre that take up just as much space
i highly recommend these head phones to any one willing to get rid of their ear budsim a professional dj and ive been using my mdrdj for almost ten years
theyre the best dj monitor headphones ive owned
i know many new products such as the popular pioneers have come out since and to be honest i havent tried many of them but these sure beat all the cans i used in the past
when you first get them you might get confused about how to fold them back up
i think i was confused for a little but maybe im just not that bright
the sound is great and the construction is definitely solid and still going strong
i love these headphones
ive traveled with them a lot
i put them on and im transferred to a different world a tranquil worldill buy another pair when these expirei bought these in a local store probably in  or  theyve made it tofrom many lans and halfway across the country
they are used on a daily basis and abused from time to time
never once have i had a complaint about these
great sound and great build dont hesitate to purchasei bought these headphones for there great specs which they live up to
i listen primarily to classical music but these are good for rock and pop as well
the bass is big deep and roomy
your amplifier doesnt need much power to drive these and you can drive them to deafening loudness levels with no distortion
even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble
the bass doesnt overpower the rest of the frequency range
right now i am on the fence as which i would recommend these sony s or the sony s
the s just seem a tad more accurate
if you are into rock or pop more and like beefier bass then i would opt for the s
i have no long term use with either
so i will defer to others as far as long term durabilitythese headphones are a must buy
they are very comfortable and have really good sound
i use them for music games movies and tv shows that i play on my computer and the sound is terrific
they have just the right amount of bass and are really good for games especially
i would recommend these headphones to anyone
in order for these headphones to last they have to be taken care of really carefully because the plastic that holds the cups on will crack if youre careless
overall these headphones are a great purchase and i will buy these againi bought these back in  and never get sick of themcan crank them up full blast without  distortionthey make everything and anything sound so much betterand actually has a cord long enough so you can stand up walk around an dance which they will make you want to do when you are wearing themthe fact that they are that good and there must not be anything comparable being made probably explains why the price has skyrocketed since i bought minei have a set of the sony mdrvdj studio monitor headphones that i use for sound reinforcement while playing my bass guitar
they are incredable and simply cant be beat
i have used other socalled highend units from other manufacturers and nothing comes close
i would recommend these headphones for fellow musicians for audiophiles for basic music listening
they simply cant be beat for the sound quality bass reproductionfirst off these headphones have the same sound technology as the sony professional headphones
the only difference is that these have a dj style
i also enjoy the slinkycoil type of cord
i enjoy the headphones very muchits unfortunate that these are being discontinued if they havent been already because these are awesome
i have long since let mine go but i regret it everyday
i recently got some skullcrushers and i think theyre okay for the price but man i really wish i still had these
i have to say though some of these prices are kinda outrageous but they hold up really well so a gently used one is a very good option
good luck and keep on the beatthese are fantastic
im a dj but now find myself toting these around everywhere because i just dont want to listen to my music without them
my fiance is not a dj but steals these from me all the time they can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion they are sturdy have a coily cord thats only connected at the left ear and fold neatly into a little bad included they totally block out outside noise
at a gig you cant hear what youre pumping over the speakers if you dont want to
at a coffee shop no one can tell your music is outrageously loud intense rich bass
even when you really crank the volume its like the bass vibrates your head instead of blasting your eardrumsa really neat little trick with these is to put them on full volume and hold the ear cups together
you can barely hear a thing but you can feel the bass thumping in your hands
when you open them youll be shocked at how much volume theyre putting outone last note i bought the s was disappointed and bought these
definitely the way to gothese are the most bass heavy headphones ive ever used and ive used and owned a lot of high end headphones including grado up to sr sennheiser hd hd hd hd hd and a high end denon of which i cant remember the model numberfor a bass enthusiast this set is what id recommend  sony mdrvdjthey arent as clear at the higher end sennheisers ive owned but they are at least in the same ball park of quality they arent destroyed by the sennheisers as far as clarity but they do have much more bass than the sennheisers
sennheiser prides itself on making a flat eq meaning typically not much bass
if youre a bass hound just sick with these sonys
i had a high end pair of denons too and they werent as all around good as the sonys in my opinon
with the mm drivers you can actually feel them vibrating on your head with a good bass lick  ive never felt that with any pair of headphones
they are quite comfortable toouse caution when buying these headphones used or on ebay
there are a lot of imitation chineese ripoff brands that are exceptionally cheap in build quality in comparison but look like a very good counterfeit
most negative reviews on these headphones have got to be from the chineese knockoff imitations sold new and used on ebay because my set is over a year old now and work perfectly after being dropped a couple times even
they are durable and imo of very high qualityi got this for a friend over a year ago  barely now theyre showing signs of use
sony deff made a good job on this onethe bass lines are so neat  clearand no matter how high you put the volume still sounds cleanive tried a lot of headphones and earbuds over the years
i returned four different pairs of various brands before i bought these sonys
they blow the competition at this price away and lots of more expensive models as well
ive had mine for over two years and they are in pristine condition
i use them almost every day and drag them around everywhere with me and they have held up admirably
the balance and sound quality are exquisite and i dont hand out compliments that easilysound quality is amazing
noise reduction is pretty good too cant hear anything once i have these bad boys onforget what you have read these are the best dj headphones in the market i should know im a dj
ive had the same pair for two years straight
im guessing that the people who say theyre flimsy doesnt take care of them
now for the review they are very comfortable theyre loud just the way i like it because of their design you dont hear the ambient noise at all love that
if youre a dj the single cup function is great
now the money makerthe bass you just dont hear the bass you feel it they actually vibrate when the bass kicks in
in my opinion these are the best headphones everi bought a pair at a box store at least  years ago
i think there great
i live in an apartment now and i use them a lot more than i did when i had my own placei always order these
they seem to last longer for me than they do for other people
maybe its in the care i dont know
i keep using these and they never fail mefor the price these headphones are very hard to beat in terms of sound and comfort
i highly recommend themi have had these headphones for more almost  years now
i am no audiophile but i can hear my  kbps mp files far better on these headphones as compared to my creative itrigue l  speakers
and by light user i mean at least one hour of use everyday
because these perform better than my desktop speakers i have them plugged in pretty much all the time
the extra long singlesided cord is useful even for home use though its really a lot sometimes
and i dont need to set my mp player volume greater than  of max iaudio x to get excellent soundyes i agree they are not built that solid
even though mine are in great condition you can still feel its mostly plastic
but i have traveled with these headphones and i have also fallen asleep wearing them
i have also experienced no problems whatsoever with the ear cupspadding
maybe i just got luckyi have been using this product for about  years now i both the first pair in  and still used it until last year when one of the cups died on me
i tried a bunch of headphones but after analyzing the price and what they offer overall i decided to buy another pair of sonys mdrvdj
they have not hailed me in in all this years swivels are great sound is amazing it is all a matter of taste and sound and as a professional dj this is my choice i would recommend it to anybodyat the time i have both this it came packed in the original package and on timegreat bass very comfortable even after hours and hours of listening
i use them for my studio work
sound is completely isolated when theyre on your head or cupped together so theres very little bleed
they are a little tight so if you have a fat head these might not be for you
they look great but handle them with a bit of care since they are plastic and seem a little prone to breaking due to the many moving partsi just purchased the sonys and im excited to share the experience
first ive owned several different headphones in past the last being the sony mdrv
i thought it would be impossible to improve on thembut sony has done itcomfort the s are allday comfortable
the earcups fit around your ears so there is no annoying pressure there
the headband is nicely padded too so you simply forget youre wearing anything at all
they are hefty and robustly constructed yet that weight simply disappears once you put them on
theyre attractively designed toowith a professional stylesound quality like i said earlier sony has worked magic here
the resolution and detailing these phones provide will have you hearing things for the first timeyoull hear things in music you never knew existed
i am pulling things out of my collection and literally enjoying them for the first time
the bass extension is phenomenala concert bass drumsmack or pipe organ will have you giggling like a kid
but they dont stop therethe mids and highs are equally wellproducedthe phones are fairly sensitive toomy small headphone amp drives them quite nicely to db levels that doctors would tell you nono
but they sound so goodyou wanna keep cranking the volumesony thoughtfully provided a nice long cord tooits coiled so it doesnt get in the wayoh mythe kickdrum in led zeppelins when the levee breaks just about blew my eyeglasses off
yeehaw
buy themyou will not regret iti will keep it simple folks
i bought them i tried them i love em
very versatile so far
im no sound expert but i know what i like
and these sonys are great
i also plan to try the beyerdynamics ts with  ohms and compare sound quality and comfort
shipping was fast and my phones were in mint condition upon arrival
thanks again amazoni dj all the time and i needed something that i felt would not steer me wrong
so these are the headphones that were recomended to me from a friend who is a dj also
i can turn and fold in about any direction you think of and gives you a great quality of sound at the same time
i dont think id be able to get the same satifaction with any other headphones
i mean what else can i ask forqualityfeelsoundetcall greatyoull pay a little morebut well worth iti hope they last
the sound quality as well as the durability make this product a hitive had my headphones for  years
im an amature dj and could only recommend these for dj usest of all the major complaint about these headphones are the cracks that appear on the swiveling brace
face it its plastic and it can break
and its not the best design for durability
but its not gonna happen to everybody
as a matter of fact a lot of record stores with turntable sampling stations will have these headphones out for use
a local record shop in hb had about a dozen of these headphones out for years of careless use
i think most people end up sitting on or packing them in heavy luggage
i cant see how you can just put these on top of your head and break themnd theyre not designed for audiophile sound quality at moderate volumes
theyre designed to monitor the next song while listening to blaring  club speakers
a device with mediocre output voltage will not move these mm drivers well enough to get good sound quality
so stay away from ipods
theyre just not gonna drive these headphones really well
imagine hooking up two  subwoofers to your car and trying to power them with your headunit
its not gonna happen
like i said these are specifically designed for djs
i use a vestax pmcpro mixer and i get crisp studio monitor quality sound
very transparent and smooth lowsrd as for the mm drivers these headphones are designed for accurate and distortion free playback at loud volumes assuming you have a clear and strong output
there are other headphones out there that have mm drivers that are designed for moderate volume levels
a lot of it is going to depend on the sensitivity of the drivers
usually lower sensitivity will handle louder volume levels better but a higher sensitivity unit will sound more accurate at lower levels
so if youre not using headphones to monitor songs at a concert or at a club go and spend your money on something elseupdate june after the swivel joints broke back in  around three years of use i was able to easily put them back using super glue
since then i have purchased and used other headphones but still occasionally use the v headphones
its definitely very worn outthe replaceable padding is cracked and the fit feels a bit loosebut they still sound great and the joints have not broken off again
yeah after it was literally brokenin they prove to stand strong with some glue on the jointsive djd with them slept with them and dropped them and i am  still using them with joy
its been with me for over ten years
i got it a few years after i graduated from college djd with them and now i am almost  with  kids and i still use them
amazing
now i will use them with care
original review from when i first purchased these headphones back in i would have given these earphones  stars
but after around  years of use the swivels broke
the swivels are made of plastic so the first place that falls apart is the swivel joint that connects to the cups
both left and right joints are cracking after approximately three years of moderate use
luckily it is still functional even with the cracks
the problem is that it is now a bit looser so it falls off from my head even more frequently
and we all know that these earphones including the v are notorious when it comes to the deterioration of the padding on the ear cups
i just wish that it would last just a bit longer
i have been looking to replace these and i found the new pioneer hdj to be a possibility
it sounds just as good it is definitely lighter and stays on the head steadier and even though the construction is similar in that it is plastic the swivel joints are built differenly from the vdjs which makes me think they knew about this sonys problem and they have found a way to prevent the joints from crackingi just purchased my second pair after neglecting to maintain my old pair
the old ones still sound great but unfortunately i didnt bother to maintain the leather part of the headphones well so they started cracking and after dropping them one of the swivels stopped working so they didnt stay on rightwith minimal precautions you too can make these last for years and years  just apply some leather protector once in a while and take care not to drop the things carelessly on the floor
these things are the best headphones ive ever owned and it was well worth another  to purchase a second pair
the first pair served me well and actually sound great still  theyre just not comfortable due in no part to the quality of the headphones themselvesthey are solid and its nice to have a cord on only one side
it really gets in your way a lot less than the typical headphone design with a cord on each sidehighly recommend these even for those of you who arent djs
these are perfect for drowning out the sound of my coworkers at my desk
i cant hear a thing and people are always waving their arms at me to get my attentionthese have an amazing level of bass better than any i have heard in any headphones before
its an experience these arethis review is to address the issue of these headphones breaking and only that because quite frankly i could go on for days about how well these headphones work for djing and everyday listening
stuff breaks this is a fact of life
cars break dishes break and even people break these headphones are no different
expecting them to last a lifetime because of the pricetag is simply naive
theres also a difference between breaking beyond function and a simple annoying break like the plastic cracking
these headphones will surely enough one day die completely as in loss of function but up to that point they will begin to fall apart
the swivel housings are the most common thing to break but from reading the reviews here on amazon it is as if people have never heard of duct tape or they are so appalled by the idea of  headphones breaking that they refuse to do anything but complain about it
the pioneer hdjs break the senheisers break and if you can find me headphones that dont break then i applaud your discovery of solid titanium headsets that dont existthis all boils down to one thing and one thing only how well do you treat your possesions
if youre like me and you dont mangle everything you own then a  pair of headphones is a safe investment because it will last
if you just play wild shows all the time wear these skatingsnowboarding throw them in your backpack or whatever then youre a moron to buy them and expect them to not break
nowhere in the description of this product does it say these things are as solid as a tank
it states that theyre flexible they are have a good bass range they do and theyre comfortable they are for me but thats a personal thingdont be deterred by reviews saying these things break because everything does and every comparable set of headphones is equally flawed
the hdjs get loose sliding fixtures really quick the senheiser s sound overall better but they feel like a plastic toy and really arent much better
if youre a dj your options are the vs and hdjs theres a reason theyre the industry standards
they are time tested and proven
if you arent willing to buy a few good pairs of headphones then djing is not the hobby for you because you will break your stuff many times not just your headphoneswell theres my rant these headphones do exactly what they say they do and for that i give them a i wanted to refute what ive read on here about these being for dj use
i couldnt disagree more
i hate dance rap and anyting to do with a club or dj
these phones are excellent for rock or anything ive tested them on
tried out hendrix floyd zeppelin metallica megadeth marley janes addiction maiden and more and i have absolutely no complaints
i can maybe notice a little about the mids being overpowered in a few spots but the base and highs sound so freakin good it blows me away
i cannot compare the s but may have purchased those if i had done more research first
you really cant go wrong with these
i cant speak for the durability but after reading the reviews i will not fold them up and plan on using them at home  of the time
the sound quality of these is astounding
dont believe the negative rantsive been buying these for over  years now
this is my third pair
no they are not crappy
i traveled to less than favorable places under less than favorable conditions and beat the ever living crap out of them
a product can only make it so far
i dont baby my stuff
having said all that i have no regrets
i love these they are so loud you can set them on the table in a room and still hear them on full blast
i will continue to buy this headset even when the next ones break
love thesei love these headphones as well as the mdrv headphones
i believe the oil from your skin over time will cause the coating to slough off of the earphone padding skin
however since hygiene is of utmost importance especially if more than one person is using the headphones i have purchased some sanitary headphone covers
this not only keeps the headphones clean it also makes the headphone ear pads last forever
just an idea but try using sanitary headphone covers on all your headphones
i believe you can buy a bag of  online for about 
its definitely worth protecting these wonderful headphones
i use them in my home studio and the frequency response is excellent and i can hear every note not to mention the exceptional large drivers mm that the headphones containi used to have these along time ago
when i first got them they were better than my other headphones i used to own
these headphones have some serious bass and treble and djs still use these headphones
they are great for part  broadcasting and hosting holiday parties when queing up a song
they are good for remixing shuffling music and running a small fm or am station
also these headphones are good for the shortwave radio listener and ham radio operator
they are the best
i hope i can get another pair soonive had my pair of vs for at least  years and they still sound great
there is a bit of wear and tear and i take good care of my things
they were with me on many outings including packing them accross europe and they have held up
the thin black stuff has peeled off a bit but it does not affect sound quality or comfortso lets see  years at 
at  a year i am very happy with this purchaseedit i still have these though i dont use them very often
too bulky and the cord is very long
they still sound great though after all these wow  years
these things are as old as my cat who is now on prescription food for his feline diabetes
in other words they have held up better than a slightly neglected petincredible headphones
im not an expert on sound like some of the other reviewers but i love to listen to music
my office can get a bit noisy at times and these headphones do the trickafter a full  hours my ears are a little tired from the headphones sitting on them but i usually dont wear them all day
the ear covers are soft and made from a very comfortable material
the sound is amazing
i think i can hear more music through these headphones than i do my stereo system at homecable has two adapters to fit most sized jacks
it is long enough to plug into my pc and still give me room to work comfortably and move around from phone to filing cabinet and back to pc with no troublesgreat buy i am really impressed with these headphones
highly recommendedwonderful wearing this headphone for long period of time  i used it for more than two hrs most of the time
clear and has great bass when turned up volume
highly recommend this itemthis is my second pair of headphones
there is absolutely no comparison with the first because this one has to be approximately x better
the bass like everyone said is crisp and clear but not exactly booming with the lows
in other words its not the same as car subs
the sound quality however is absolutely incredible
im able to hear certain noises in music and gaming that i havent ever heard from my speakersthe headphones arent technically noise cancellation but i cant hear a single thing anyone is saying when theyre standing next to me
i dont even have the noise that loudthere are a couple complaints i have about this product but they are minor
first the design of the headphones are shaped to fit ones ears
because of that it isnt possible to wear them the other way
luckily the cord is very long and coils up so it wont tangle up
the second complaint i have is that my ears become extremely hot and uncomfortable after just  minutes or so
to combat that i just take them off for a good  seconds and its fine again
it does get annoying thoughim no audiophile so i cant judge the quality in comparison to other headphones but i would most certainly buy this product againi have been in the entertainment industry for thirty five plus years  watching to pros around me use these headphones must have stuck in my head  i just started a new business needed headphones and the mdrvs became the obvious choice  they are comfortable to wear  have a long cable and seem to reproduce a fine spectrum of natural sound  i love these things  i just wonder why i waited this long  i should have had these to listen to my music a long while ago  there greatwhile shopping for new headphones i just realized i bought this item as a kid years ago thanks amazon for reminding me when ive bought somethingim not an audiophile so i wouldnt be able to elaborate on the specifics of sound acoustics but i can tell you this ive had loud neighbors in the past and these headphones were able to block them out
ive never had any complaints about the quality of the music playing through this
listening to music with this is quite superb the bass midrange and highs are all equally thereas for the build quality these have definitely stood the test of time
the original fabriclike material that was surrounding the earpieces and headband have cracked and worn awaythis does not affect sound quality
in fact i think the extra material is on there to make it easy to clean when the headphones get dirty
the cord looks like the day i got it the printing on the plastic has not worn awaythe only minor issue and this is mainly because ive read about it from others is creaking sound when turning your head
the cause of this is the plastic twisting and bending
again i never really noticed it until others pointed it outi havent had to replace these for  years so gather what you will from that statement
i do not need new headphones but i am window shopping should these ever break and i hope they dont
i originally bought these for  so im not sure why its now 
if you can get them at a good rate i do recommend these fantastic headphonesthese ear phones are very comfortable and the sound quality is really good tooi have had these for a long time
excellent product
recently my wife was telling me that i had black dandruff and would knock a few very small pieces of some kind of black material from the side of my face
it took  months to realize that the specs were coming from the headphone covers
they were slowly deterioratingthe good news is that there are replacement covers for just a few bucks
should be here tomorrowupdate received the new covers and while it was a job putting them on i prevailed
the headphones look brand newstill rate them as a billcape codi have had  pairs of these and they are the best
awesome sound reproduction
very true reproduction for those of us who scoff at the bass boost buttons
i used both primarily for live sound mixing
but after these it is hard to use anything else in you mp player
the size adjustment keeps them comfortable
the flip earphone allows you to hold it up to your ear for a quick listenthe first pair was a travel pair and went on plane flights car rides remote shows
after excessive abuse one of the ear phone joints broke
i repaired it once and that lasted about  yearthe second pair sits on the board at our church
they have been there for years
the ear phone foam is starting to flake off onto those of us with facial hairmy headphones are a bit worse for wear my fault but these are my goto headphones when i really want to enjoy a piece
good frequency response high and low
very comfortable even with allday usei just use this for my amplifier on guitars and ukuleles
guess whatits ideal
comfortable quiet for others true sounds reproduction
ive worn it for oh maybe an hour straight and its big enough to be comfortable on my ears
it has no funny hissing or suchi am not a earphone guru like some of these reviewers
sometimes too much tech knowledge can be a hindrance to good judgement  i personalty just wanted a middle priced quality headphone specifically for my amplifier for my high end guitars and ukuleles
this is wonderful
love it
wish i could kiss it
i think i willevery night i listen to a cd holosync by centerpointe while going to sleep
the cd has a range of frequencies from deep bass down to as low as  hz to midrange
also since i travel frequently the headphones need to be sturdywhen my previous headphones by sennheiser died i purchased these to use for the cd insteadfrom an audio quality standpoint with my old sennheiser headphones i could hear some subtle nuances in the audio at slightly lower volume than i can with these headphones
then again the sennheiser headphones cost  while these cost however my sony headphones serve me very well
they produce good but not great sound so i can clearly hear the bass and midrange without turning up the volume
because the ear cups are soft and comfortable the top is padded and the headphones themselves are lightweight i can easily fall sleep with the headphones onthe coiled cord is extremely handy keeping the headphones from becoming too tangledbeyond that the headphones themselves are sturdy standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch
also they are very affordable about  from amazoncomthe only issue is if i wanted headphones to use while working out these headphones wouldnt do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat
however for my nonworkout needs these are excellentalthough the audio isnt quite professional quality these are an excellent set of headphones for the moneyi use these at work when im busy and need to concentrate
i work in a cubicle with people who like to laugh and joke loudly
thats great except when i have a deadline
i put these on and listen to a cd or the radio and it shuts out the noise to the point where i can actually get some work done
i think the sound quality is great
the coiled cord is about  feet long or so and stretches out nicely
sonys page says the cord is  feet long extended
it allows me to move about a small area in my cubicle without it getting tangled
they are the only headphones ive been able to wear all day long without hurting my head
id buy them again especially at this pricei think these are great headphones
i have tried the sony mdrvs bought a pair and gave them away couldnt stand them some expensive shure inear headphones i felt like my ears were going to bleed after wearing them and some sony mdrsin the end the vs work the best for me so far
they have great sound reproduction i can wear them for hours at a time and im super sensitive i could wear the vs for about  hour a day before i had to take them off and they are a great value
the plastics used in their construction seem to be good quality and they are aesthetically pleasing not incredibly so but they are certainly not uglyi asked an engineer that has done a ton of work w dj premier  w a ton of famous artists in rap  hiphop for a decently priced but still quality headphone back in  he hit me back w a link to the mdrv for  so i bought them
now i see the price is over double that
i can definitely undertand why
they have a really great sound quality even at the  dollar price tag
the highs are crisp and the bass hits deep
ive used them soley for the past  years and wear them sometimes for up to  hours w very little discomfort  obviously taking breaks throughout
they are also extremely durable and made w heavy duty plastic cordage  parts and can definitely take some hits and drops
the cord is also long enough to provided a great distance to move around and access other equipment around the studio
considering how much i paid for them they were definitely a steal but regardless they are some headphones ill probably use for atleast  or  more years
i can certainly say these are some of the best headphones ive ever owned
overall comfort durability  superb sound quality made these the perfect pair for methese headphones are terrific
i use them all the time for listening to music and watching movies
i have had them for a few years now and they still work just as good as the day i bought them
they have a nice long  cord so you dont have to sit close to your receiver or dvd player
if you  are looking for a set of headphones these are one of the best for its  price rangei bought the sony mdrv headphones about  seasons ago and have loved them ever since
i bought them refurbished from amazoncom at the time and paid  for them including shipping
mind you those were used refurbished headphones but they and their packaging looked like new and performed and still perform like new
i am baffled to see them being sold for  on amazon now even though their traditionally more expensive and higher quality siblings the mdrv and mdr are offered for  and  less respectively
if you were planning to spend the stated  on the sony mdrv headphones do yourself a favor and try the mdrv or mdr insteadwith that said i love my vs and have never regretted the purchase
the bass is subtle but still obviously present while the highs can get painfully high when paired with my macbook pro  model which has a good onboard dac in it
this is reflected in the advertised frequency range of  hz and it surprised me since in my experience sony headphones traditionally sound a bit heavy on the bass and muffled
in comparison these headphones produce super clear soundbest of all the vs are comfortable
so much so that i can wear them for hours on end during study sessions and never get tired of wearing them
they work well with my old ipod video generation  gb and different computers which means the headphones dont use a lot of powerverdict if you can find these headphones for  it is a deal you should never pass up
i thought they sounded better and more accurate than a friends akg  which was admittedly more comfortable and durable but still
those looking to spend  on headphones and are interested in the mdrv should save themselves  and get the higherquality v or mdr insteadthese are good headphones for the price
they deliver brilliant fidelity across the audio spectrum
i was really impressed by both the bass and treble reproduction and response and their ability to envelop my ears diminishing outside sounds
i use these with a yamaha receiver
they deliver very good sound with this receiver
the receiver can play a factor on how sound and music is reproduced through these headphones
that is something you should consider when choosing any headphonesthese are the official headphones for the holosync user
i have used them with some of the new audio d sound that the higher levels of holosync use and they were amazing
the knock at the door and the whisper in one ear on the demo cd for the sound technology i think it is called audiophonics made me jump thru the roof  the sound was so real
i think these headphones are very comfortable  they have the adapters  both small and large  that come with them you dont have to buy separate ones and the cord is long flexible and coiled
i thought amazon had a very decent price for them ive seen them at x or x the price
no complaints at all  i really like them a loti purchased these three years and four months ago they still sound as good as day one
all sound is crisp and clear
they are comfortable for many hours
i got them for sixty six bucks
the ear foam has started to wear out and flake off so i bought replacements for eight bucks
hope to get many more years service out of themim pretty sure that ive had these headphones since  i cant believe they still make the same model mine look exactly like the model picturedafter fourteen years the material covering the foam padding is starting to crack but they still sound greati paid like  for these
i should have bought a few but i didnt know they price would jump so high
i paid less than half of what they are currently going for on amazon
they just happen to have a frequency response that my meditation cds require
so i bought them for that purpose
they do a great job and theyre also high quality headphones
what more could i ask fori had this head phone for  years now i bought in  when i was single and had cash and was looking for best head phone i could buy
i got in  for  bucks thought was alot but has last for  years now and still sound as good as any head phone i have had
my kids have used them too now days i see these dre beat and other head phones and see people go through them head phone and wonder what they do to them you pay for head phone that cost that much you would expect them to last
i went through whole decade with these i saw headphone get smaller and smaller now getting bigger and bigger
which is funny but i have had this pair and nothing go wrong with them  can wear all day without problem
i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding head phones that will last
i see the price has double since i bought them last but will being another pair whenever these go out if they ever dothese are good blocks off all sound so you stay focused so when im in grind mode in the studio im in grind mode
only thing is if listening on high volume in a tight place like the car everyone will hear what your listening to
everyone
just wish somehow it would stay within the headphones and youim just an average guy who likes listening to music
i also use them for privacy when watching tv in a full house
ill let the audiophiles give the specshigh  lowsbass  treble reviews
i bought these to replace my jbls see my review of those
yes i understand those were bluetooth and these are not
i really didnt care that they were wire only
these headphones are very comfortable
the giant earpads engulf your ears
the leather or what im guessing is leather is very smooth
im hoping for some durability there but i cant attest to it so early after purchase
they are big enough that i dont have to extend the ear pads at all
the headpiece is soft but solid
no worries there
i use mine at the desk so the cord is plenty long enough for me
i havent had them on a plane so i cant say how they will do on blocking out noise but im hopeful ill update on that as it happens
one last common man observation and maybe i missed it in amazons description the plug is a standard stereo sized plug but you can unscrew is and underneath is a mm plug
anyway really like them and for the price you cant go wrongthese headphones are almost indistinguishable from the sony  model which may well be the most popular headphones in american recording studios
i have both
i think the vs are lighter weight so a little more comfy for long sessions or wearing all day in an office or somethingthe cord attached to only one side is great
the phones quotseal upquot really well with a true closedback design
if you squeeze the cups shut together you can just barely hear them even if its cranked up to bust your eardrums
this in spite of the fact that they are plastic
you cannot hear the outside world when these phones are at normal levels
when theyre cranked up somebody could be shouting in your face and youd think they were lipsyncingbesides being wellsealed and loud these phones give a big smooth sound that wont give you a headache or have you wondering what youre missing
as another reviewer mentioned theyre very efficient producing a ton of volume with very little power  and its volume you can stand unlike lesser models that will hurt your ears at similar decibel levelsif youre looking for the pro version  its the  and only available at musicalrecording outlets
here all you have to do is click that button and soon youll be listening to headphones that id buy again and again if i lost or destroyed themi have been using these headphones for nearly eight years and they still sound incredible
they catch the highest highs and lowest lows and the construction is built to last
i use these for djing and i have hauled these headphones to countless clubs and gigs with nary a problem in all the years ive used them
i also have a pair at home that sound great no matter what youre plugging them into be it a stereo an ipod or a television set
for the price you simply cannot get a better pair of headphones for the price
buy with confidenceim not much of an audiophile and i admit that i initially shuddered at the thought of dropping so much cash on a set of headphones
but then a friend of mine recommended these said i wouldnt regret it
im happy to say that he was right
watching movies and listening to music became an entirely different experience
brought out the best in my cds and dvds and the worst out of my lowbitrate mps
every little click and hiss became clear as day
found myself reencoding a bunch of my old stuff at higher bitrates but it was worth it
best of all they block quite a bit of outside noise
great for getting some peace and quiet in even the most chaotic of environmentsand thats not all
they pack neatlythey fold and fit snugly in the included vinyl pouch which is surprisingly durable
the headphones themselves have held up pretty well but then im pretty gentle with them
the cords plenty long and doesnt tangle easily
these little touches make all the differenceif you have more discerning tastes you may be better served by something else more refined and likely more expensive
but if youre looking to move up from cheapo  headsets this is as good a place as any to startsony headphones deliver great sound no matter if you plug it in a stereo or portable device
i love the crisp soundi have used a pair of mdrv headphones to finetune critical mixes and do any and all other client audio work for i think over a decade
i have replaced the ear cushions once which was surprisingly easy to do
i cannot imagine what reviewers are thinking of when they describe the sound as muddy  these have served me well as a reference standard for all the work i do
i have tried several other pairs of highend cans and i keep coming back to these
i think i paid twice what you can find them for now back in the day i seem to remember a  price tag and seriously contemplate every few months shelving a second pair for safekeepingive been in the broadcasting business for over  years and these are the best headphones ive ever used
it took some convincing to invest in them since i usually bought cheaper headphones
but the cheap ones last a few months and the sony mdrvs last years
you wont be sorry with this headphonesive owned the v the  and the vs
ive been happy with all three though if i had to pick id take the vs
and im fairly critical when it comes to headphones
anyone trying to divine perfection among these three really needs to go audition all of them to see which they prefer
they differ but are comfortable yield highquality sound and are wellmade
i wouldnt have a problem recommending any of them
the differentiators are these the v and  are almost identical though the s are more expensive are flatter in response and more suited to studio use
the v is a massmarket headphone wellsuited to general listening use with a sound that tends toward warmer and bassiermy current set of vs is getting pretty tired and ill probably audition all three again myself
to anyone reading reviews to figure out which to buy my advice is to not overanalyze it  unless you already have a preference buy whichever is the best deal at the time
chances are youll be more than happy
sony makes superb headphonesive always gone the cheap route and purchased  headsets that would last for a couple years and develop crackly sounds along the way
tiring of that in my middle age i decided to spring for something a bit better but first checked with amazons reviews
this led me to the mdrv headset which was about 
should have done it a long time ago  money well spent
excellent volume range comfortable covers my ears so well that it excludes all outside noise even at moderate output
i used them mostly for listening to itunes on my computer while i do other things
occasionally to practice pianokeyboard
like i said money well spent although i have only had them a couple months
other reviewers give high marks for longevity so i expect they will be satisfying for me as welllet me just preface this minireview by stating that im not an audiophile so in terms of these headphones on a technical level i cant say muchi can say however that i had decided about two years ago that i needed headphones for my computer and so i went to jr music and computer world to try ones oni tried these and they sounded great to me again being a nonaudiophile and they were extremely comfyhere it is two years later and the headphones still work fantastically are still comfortable and still sound greattheyre not noise cancelling however if you have loud music playing odds are you wont be able to hear your roommate shouting at you from behind
in addition since i can tell the difference between say a kbps mp and a lossless version of the same song i can still notice the same difference on these headphones
yes this is a matter of audio compression but the point im trying to infer there is that even the small details of audio compression dont go unnoticed with these headphonesvery highly recommendedheadphones are highly personal devices so dont be surprised to see wide variances of opinion
in fact i have yet to discover an quotallpurposequot pair
imagine an equalizer board with  slider switches adjustable in any number of configurations
boost the treble and upper midrange while cutting back on the bass and you have the panasonic s which are perfect for concentrating on ellas voice or tony williams ride cymbal but not on nelson riddles orchestral arrangements or ray browns bassthe sony mdrvs may be as close to a quotuniversalquot accurate set of headphones as you can get for under a hundred and fifty
compared to my mdrs which my son quotborrowedquot theyre more comfortable and the sound is more quotflatquot ie
accurate faithful undoctored
if your tastes extend beyond contemporary pop and youre serious about sound quotfidelityquot beware of those quotdjquot models with the bass boost brainshaker and virtualreality features
and as a previous reviewer has pointed out this model is identical with the higherpriced quotprofessionalquot phones sony is listing as model   perhaps sony plans to make the s the only available models call it quotcosteffective marketing because there are currently some great deals on the mdrvsmy only quotcomplaintquot is the extreme degree to which the vs seal off all outside sound making me feel like im trapped in a cocoon theyre ideal for antisocial or solipsist personalities
these phones are a pleasure now and then but im still happy with my sennheiser pxs for  of my listeningi am a freelance camera operator and sometimes i end up having to edit projects
since i dont edit often i did not want to spend lots of money on studio headphones but at least wanted something that would cancel out the outside world when i edited and this does just that
i was so impressed i took it out in the field with me on sets and its great
i cant hear anything unless someone talks into the microphone going to the camera which is great
i love these headphonesthe quality of sound on these things is amazing
good bass and amazing clarity
i am hearing things in my music ive never heard beforei used a pair of sony v studio monitor headphones for about  years until they became unrepairable
i didnt realize that this was a blessing in disguise
i purchased the v headphones as a replacement since they addressed my greatest complaint with the vs ear compression
i use my headphones daily to listen to music while working in my cubicle
this amounts to at least  hours of use  days a week  weeks a year
thats at least  hours of use per year
i dont need my ears pressed up against my head by illfitting headphones
the vs have a circumaural design that encloses all but the largest of ears
theyre comfy and sound superfantastic
i love these headphonesbest sony product i have purchased lately
my  year old has autism and we bought this for one of his cd sessions
it was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his cds
i want to get a pair myselfi first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version the mdr for more than  years as a professional field video producer
i bought the mdrvs for home use and they look and sound new after  years of occasional use at homethese are an overtheear headphone meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them  they sit on your head but not on the ears which means that your ears dont get sore
this also acoustically isolates you from your environment
however if you sweat heavily they also tend to trap moisturesound reproduction is excellent and fullrange and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones you will hear well and you wont hear much of whats going on around you outside the phones
they do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies but thats something that most people dont mindthe screwon  tip screws off to reveal a  stereo plug so the phones work with most playback devices
i highly recommend them as durable acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many yearsive had these headphones for at least  years
theyve been stepped on constantly thrown around used for countless gamingmusic listening hours and even had my dog chew on them for a bit
they still work finegreat sound quality reliable durable and so comfortable you dont know theyre on sometimes
 starsmy wife and i have been using a meditation program for over a year holosync and these headphones are recommended by the company to use if you want to enhance the listening experience
we had good results using just earbuds and more advanced listening devices arent necessary until you get to advanced levels of the program but we decided wed give them a try
they were also much cheaper from amazon than buying from centerpointethey really have improved the listening experience
i have some slight hearing loss and these headphones allow me to hear a greater range of sound without having to turn the volume up too high
the headset is very lightweight and comfortable for the bulk of it
the cord is long and dangling and is really too much for an ipod which of course theyre not really made for anyway but its easy to reign in when necessaryif you get them keep in mind that the bigger connector plug can be unscrewed to reveal the more common mini plugover all we give them two thumbs upi gave these headphones a five star rating because the sound is very clear
you get good separation and a feeling of spatial separation and distance
they work great
they are comfortable
its just too bad i cant use themi bought these because other reviewers extolled the virtues of these headphones for sealing out the noise of their busy offices
any headphone can drown out surrounding noise
be warned
these are not well sealed
the sony product manual packed with the mdrv headphones cautions customers not to disturb those close byif you also got the impression that these closed headphones would allow you to listen privately you will be disappointed
i work in an office doing data entry
i like to listen to wild profane and controversial stuff and i dont want people listening in
these headphones would disturb my colleagues if i used them at work
you can hear them clear and loud even when pressed firmly togethernobody i work with wants to hear the sex pistols sing the good ship venus
so as good as the mdrvs are the little headphones that came with my player are better because i can crank them up and only i can hear them
too bad because these are so much more comfortablealso i should mention i got refurbished mdrv headphones
the screws that hold them together do not all match some are silver and some are black
then it probably goes without saying that they are made in china not japanmy oldest son had this model for several years and my other son  or his dog or some imaginary elf hadapparently ruined these beyond repairand never to be found again according to the oldest son
to savebloodshed i hopped on amazon and found the exact model available and shipped home in a few daysamazon is the placethese are the best headphones ive ever owned
i recently purchased a replacement pair as my original set died after  years of intensive use
they were repeatedly abused shoved in and out of my bag and under seats on airplanes and generally not treated very well
they have stood the test of time and really performed welli am a designer and i wear headphones all day long at work so comfort is imperative
while these headphones are large they are extremely comfortable and block out my obnoxious coworkerswhile the earpads will wear away in time as they did with my old set the comfort and quality is not compromised
i have purchased these as gifts for fellow music lovers and twice now for myself
i couldnt recommend them enoughin the last  years i tried a number of phone headsets by different manufacturers
this one was the best  lightweight adjustable metal headband not plastic extremely comfortable small unbreakable mic wand easily accessible earpiece volume and mute control and mic volume control which is not common for headsets in this price range
i used the previous headset for years until i moved overseas
now im back i am delighted to have another onei had a plantronics headset before and theyve definitely improved on what i already liked  great sound qualitymost people say they cant tell i have any background noise even when im in the car and comfortable headseti use the overtheear version of it so i can hear best and theyve added a mute button on the headset cord as well as the volume controla great value for the money and hard to improve on for any pricethis purchase was for a backup of one i had bought previously that has worked very well
after reading other reviews where people had stated that it only lasted  months before breaking i bought another one for back up
i have found it to be very comfortable and have used it several times for  hour conversations
i have put my phone in my shirt pocket and roamed the house while talking with no loss of clarity
i may have to buy another one as my wife is thinking of using the backup
i dont think the unit is that fragile but some people are hard on things
i dont know if i would recommend it for continuous all day use but if handled with reasonable care it seems it should last a lot longer then  monthsi have used this very model headset for many years and yes after several years they do wear out as do many things but when i had to replace the one i had i found it here at amazoncom and not only were they new but they were the least expensive i could find anywhere
some site were asking as much as  times what i paid here thanks once again amazoncomive had this model for years
im happy to keep buying them when they wear out because the sound quality is good and the mute button on the cord is a lifesaver when office interruptions happen in the middle of a phone call
ive used this model for over  years with a radio shack headset amplifier and the nortel and polycom phone systems
love itafter trying dozens of headsets for my phone i was a little hesitant to try another one but ive heard good things about the plantronics brand so i thought id give this a try
most of the headsets ive used suffered from poor reception or poor design or both
i was both pleased and surprised that the mc excels in looks and function
calls received were crisp and clear with no static or noise of any kind
the headset can be used over the head or folded to place behind the ear
it comes with a nice cushy ear piece if you decide to use it over your head which i did
the volume control on the cord has a clip above it so you can attach it to your shirt or pocket and easily adjust the sound with the small thumb wheel
this works remarkably well and i find myself using it more than the volume control switch thats on my phone
because the headset is so light even after wearing it for a couple hours i can hardly tell i have it on
its so nice to finally be able to move around make a cup of coffee wave my hands in the air or whateveri highly recommend the mc to anyone who wants a decent headset for their phonethis headset is my favorite
ive used them for years and they wear out from use which is to be expected
i hope they keep producing it
if the headband is too tight for you just bend it a little
it also comes with an ear loop
great incoming and outgoing volume controlsfor the price you cant beat this little headset
the mute switch sets it apart from other headsets which is a musthave feature for conference callsit is also comfortable and in my expererience fairly durable
ive used this headset for  years with no complaints
in fact im listening to a conference call on it right nowi find these headsets perfect for use on my home telephone
it allows me to make phone calls while im doing other things whether its doing dishes or typing on the computer
the party on the other side never knows im using a headset as the voice quality is perfectthis headset is worth every extra penny
ive used this model and its siblings for  years and attest to the quality and value of plantronics equiptment
ive bought three of their phones  as gifts and have never  had a problem
when one of their products eventually wore down from high  use they replaced it promptly with no hassle
they make most of the call  center equiptment in the world and it showsthis is a great product made  by a great companyive had this gadget for a while now
it was well thought out and it works well
im completely pleased
i made my decision based on the comments by amazon reviewers
thanks for the good advice peoplei enjoy this overthehead headset
i have tried overtheear and earbud handsfree units but this is by far the most secure and comfortable handsfree style
the volume control is easy to use and it has handy mute onoff switch
no more finding the mute button and adjusting the volume on my treo  anymore pretty dangerous while driving
my only complaint is the volume is a little low if youre talking to a softspoken person
but its tough anyway to listen to himher without the headset plus you can detach the cushion on the earpiece so the receiver is a little closer to your eari was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition but was lured by the halfprice price tag when compared to a new headset
i envisioned all sorts of shortcomings but when it arrived i was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset
it is clean
no scratches
no faded labeling
it looked to be brand new
oh yeahit works great toonow that i have used it for sometime now i can say that it holds up to what i put it through so i would recommend it to my friends and the time it took to get was right on time and now i just put my headset on instead of having to hold the phone up to my ear so i can have more of the long conversationsthis is a great product
i was able to purchase it from amazon for only  and definitely got my moneys worth
i like this model because it has volume controls for both your voice output and your hearing input
i use it as a headset and the only complaint i have is that the speaker has a lot of bass
there are not any highs in the voice you hear so your friends voice always sounds emotionless and flat
i guess it is this way to protect your hearing
the sound is quite clear just a limited frequency responsei am in a job that requires me to be on the phone all the time
i have been using this same exact brand of plantronics headset for years
it lasts about  years but that seems about the norm with all the headsets i have had or have heard about from others
i like that there is a mute option on the wire and it is very comfortableive had this product for about a year and half
ive had no problems at all
people can hear clearly on the other end the mute switch doesnt make any noise volume control seems adequate
its been very durable too ive dropped it on the floor a bunch of times and it has been unaffected
most importantly the sound reproduction quality is excellent
other headsets ive used in the past have degraded the sound quality noticablythis is a great unit
ive had it about  weeks now
i use it with my ge  ghz cordless home phone and it works fine
i work from home  days a week and attend or host conference calls about  times a day
my coworkers tell me i sound loud and clear
the set is comfortable lightweight but not flimsy or fragile with padded ear piece
i especially like the mute switchvolume control on the cord
the cord is long enough to give me plenty of slack with the phone clipped to my waist band and im  so thats important
i would highly recommend this unitmy biggest problem is the so keeps borrowing this when she takes conference calls at homeok  second problem
now i have a usb headset for skypeetc and a wired headset for cell phones and when traveling i usually dont bring the usb headset  too fragile
so now my nest of wires has gotten a little worse
generally i dont like the qualityreliability of bluetooth but i may try again in the next few monthsi bought this headset to use with my cordless phone system which i use with skype
i have a bluetooth headset on my left ear and i keep this one on my right so i can answer my cell phone and the regular phone simultaneously while i am working on my computer
i use only motorola cell phones and bluetooth units and previous cordless phone headsets left a lot to be desired
the plantronics unit is wondeful its light enough that i forget its there and even halfdeaf me can hear it well
the adjustable hearing is great as is the adjustable volume on the microphone
i heartily recommend itive been using one of these for years
i replace it with a new one when the old one wears out
the mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice and i never have complaints about people not being able to hear me
the earpad is comfy and i occasionally forget i have this on
the best part is the adjustable amplifier  if i have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone i can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset and i usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion
i dont have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation throughlove this type of headset
i use one at work every day so i got one for home too
i hate things in my ear so this quality overthehead type keeps everything where it belongs and i can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation
comfortable and lightweight
doesnt even mess up hair
it includes a leatherette cup for the ear speaker but i usually dont even use it finding it comfortable even without it
it converts to an ear hook type also but i dont find that very useful
the inline volume control and mute is nice although a bit large and heavy
great sound qualitythis headset works great
ive been using it for several weeks now and the sound is clear and the fit is comfortable
i spend several hours a day on the phone so comfort was a biggie for meconvenient and easy to use  allows you to carry on a conversation and still listen in on conference callsbottom line plantronics makes the best headsets
ive been very happy with this one
people say they can hear me very clearly and its very comfortable to wear on long conference calls
if it breaks in the future im sure ill buy another plantronics headset this model or a comparable onesomeone told me that plantronics was cheap but i beg to disagree
yes the price was quite reasonable but the quality sound is greati had bought several of the walmart variety headsets and was getting pretty frustrated with their quality lack of mute feature etc so finally i decided to spend some real money
i have a plantronics headset at work that is decent so i bought this one
its even better than my headset at workit is convertible from headset to earpiece for those who like that sort of thing
the little padded thingy for the earpiece when used in headset configuration is very comfortable
i dont notice any discomfort even after  hours of usage
there is a mute switch on the wire and both the earpiece and microphone volumes are adjustablei have only had mine for a month or so so i cant comment on the durability issues yet
apparently im not as acrobatic as some reviewers so i dont expect problemsi really cant think of anything that i do not like about this piece of equipmentplantronics is always a dependable brand and the quality of sound both incoming and outgoing is just as i expectedi got a panasonic kxtca and this plantronics mc
the plantronics mc is definitely better
it is more comfortable and the microphone is more sensitive and has better sound qualityscotti had been looking for a good headset to use with my cordless phone at home
i have tried many headsets and none worked well enough for the people on the other end of the call to hear me
with this headset i can hear everyone clearly and they can hear me clearly
the price was great as well under good sound quality
good price
convenient inline mute mic and earpiece volume controls
versatile
will get uncomfortable for allday users
imo better than similar panasonic with the silly foam covered boom micthey fit they are not tiresome the sound is clear
all of the features work flawlessly
people are very satisfied when i am on them there is no strange sound to my calls
it comes with the short cable i need to use with my panasonic handsets
it is light weight and having the controls on the line make it perfect for my use
if i needed another set for another location in my home i would buy the same product againthese have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties
the volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some timewith so few sources remaining for ibm formatted floppy disks i was relieved to find them available on amazon
with old computers still in use and with sony mavica floppy disk cameras still in circulation the demand for fresh new disks however rapidly dwindling it might be is definitely still therethe quality may have slipped a bit over the years since of the many boxes i purchased each had one or two defective disks that would not read or write regardless of the efforts to reformat them
even so it was still a bargaingood product
the floppy disks worked fine as advertisedfyi i bought an external usb floppy drive to write these disks in the modern pcsmostly for reprogramming bios on old motherboardsi bought a pair of headphones from another company for  way more money
i stumbled on these as i didnt want to leave such expensive headphones in my desk at work
turns out i never should have bought the more expensive pair
im sure there are better ones on the market but for my ears these are more than enoughi order these headphones in may  and ive been using these since on average about hrsday up until about august and have been using them on and off since
these are great headphones
they produce quality sound provide great comfort even for giant dumbo ears like mine and theyre super sturdy
there are my first pair of headphones of this quality so i dont really have anything to compare to other than beats ear buds but these are two very different products
in all these outperform the beats earbuds in every aspect except for portability comfort and sound cancelling abilitythese headphones will take some time to get use to if youre not used to wearing bulky headphones they weight about a pound or so
with the weight the band tends to sit on the top of head regardless of how i adjust it and it caused a little pain initially but its no longer a problem because ive gotten used to it
the headphones are completely over the ears so that took some time to get used to as well because that can also cause a little pain initially as well ive also gotten used to this
one other problem is the adapter the mm adapter is massive and sticks out of my computer like  so its nearly impossible to use it with the computer at an incline ie on a laptop chill pad or even watching it on your lapeven with this all said its still the best pair of headphones ive owned and it seems like itll continue providing quality sound for many years to comegot these to monitor my new sony nxu video camera
like everyone says they dont color the sound which is important when monitoring the sound from the camera
you dont want any unnatural enhancement that isnt really there
about the tightness for me they are perfect
they are not tight at all
i have an average size head for a  lb guy
the cord is long too and it has a tight spring to it so that if you walk away from the camera forgetting that these are on your head you wont pull the camera off the tripodidk it the faults i find are just because its supposed to be a certain way but these headphones dont make me bob my head and feel the music when im listening to it
buts its probably because it doesnt have that warmth a lot of people mention about
it picks up every single freakin detail though like the reverb from tupacs song who do u believe in ive never heard such clarity like that in any headphones ive had even from the koss portapro which are also freakin amazing
the bass in this isnt outstanding either but its probably intended to be like that so all of the things i knock it off for is probably because theyre not intented to be that way
so in conclusion these head phones to me arent really my option to listen to tunes but are mainly for recording which is why i bought them
so doh yeah and its a bit sensitive in my headphone jack on my macbook pro a little staticy sound very very faint is noticeable when u move the jackbest headphones i have ever had
these are also the most expensive headphones i ever purchased
so i cant really compare them to more expensive brandsi find that it is much easier to distinguish between different instruments and musical notes with these headphones as they provide much less blurring together of sound that other cheaper headphones i have ownedthe only problem i had was that the headband started to cause the top of my head to hurt after about hr to and hour to fix this i just cut out a piece of memory foam from my beds mattress cover and used rubber bands to strap it to the headbandit looks ridiculous but works greatjust love them
they are loud a lot
sound crispy and the bass is great
i use them for my desktop and the long cord let me move free
i recomend these a lot
ps they get a little warm on your earsupdate after using them for one year i have to say that all my other headphones sucks p 
the sound of these v are way wayyyyy better than any other i ever had
watching movies with dts and my v its just awsome
im very glad i got themas the title of my review implies i am a former kossloverwas not necessarily a sonyhater since ive been buying their earbuds for years however although ive heard sony headphones previously purchasing the v was still a chore since i had never actually bought a pairpreferring the koss tds and tds over the sony offerings however koos has ceased those models and have adopted lesser engineering
thus sony was a breath of fresh airive allowed these headphones to fully break in before using them for any recordings i recorded with them yesterday
damn
wow damn and wow again
the quality of the soundthe true full range of the soundwas stunningalmost made me forget what i was recording
excellent pair of headphones
at this point i want to purchase another pair but ill wait until i have a surplus of funds since it seems the price keeps going up on themif youre on the fencestop playingget these
if youre not using these for recording or not going to use these on a more amplified source such as a home receiver or headphone amplifier of some sort dont fret ive listened to these on my tmobile mytouch with sufficient sound and quality sound reproductionso im sure your ipod will do fine
enjoyi bought these after a lot of research and i am glad that i did one of my coworkers actually got the more expensive mdr  and we ended up doing a side by side sound test
we played some flac files through vlc using the focusrite usb i dac and though they both sound good on their own you can clearly tell that the  is coloring the sound significantly
also the bass response on these seems to be better as wellsome people have complained about the comfort of these and i have worn them for hours on end while working and have found them to be incredibly comfortable
i might enjoy the new ear pads because they supposedly help improve the sound quality ifwhen i do i will update this to see if the combination is worth the hasslemoneyall in all amazing headphones especially considering the price you cannot go wrong with thesemy husband loves listening to music when he goes to bed and i hate it
he suggested i get these for him so that he can listen and i can sleep in peace
i think i love them more than he does
he used to use just ear buds and i could hear what he was listening to plain as day
i cant hear anything when he is using these headphones
he says that the sound with these are fantastic like youre in a home theater
we both think they are worth the moneyim taking a digital music course this semester and so the class requires a pair of highquality headphones in lieu of a textbook
being a perpetually poor audiophile who then had an excuse to buy nice headphones on somebody elses dime i settled down to research
after hours and hours of looking and reading ratings and trying on different styles in the stores i finally settled on the sony mdrv having been warned away from the newer sony model that was supposed to replace them
obviously the ear cups havent died yet but i know they will in a few years and i dont mind at alli just got them in earlier this afternoon and i havent taken them off since without it being absolutely necessary
ive been listening to music for hours now
the biggest fear i had with buying new headphones was that they wouldnt be able to reproduce both sharp highs and smooth lows with clarity and without sibilance
after about an hour of listening to emilie autumns electric violin which has both in abundance i have to say that my fears were laid to rest
i then moved on to the rest of my music library and so far  with only a few hours of breakingin  it all sounds amazing
metal rock classical reggaeton electric jazz trance everything
theres a touch of bass that i cant usually hear and im not sure if thats enhancement from the phones or just because i can actually hear better now but i like itall in all one of the best notatextbooks ive ever bought and i see myself loving these way after this class is overi cant stand those tinny earbuds
i bought the best ones i could find for my droid  and they seemed ok for awhile
then i purchased the fiio d and paired it with these headphones
what can i sayits awesome
the fiio on low gain with eq set to zero my droid volume as loud as it would go makes these headphones loud
really loud
at high gain theyre too loud
but even then theres no distortion
none
the sound is crisp and clear
drums sound like youre standing in front of the drummer
its like youre on stage
just like the other reviews say you can hear things in the music that you dont even notice using the headphones mortals useit comes with a nice carrying bag
the bag has a drawstring
its a nice leather or faux leather bag but with the drawstring i cant put the extras in without worrying about them falling out in the wrong place
but i didnt expect the bag so who cares
the phones fold up easily and quickly and wont take up much carryon spacethese phones are really comfortable
i was worried that they would sit on my ears but my ears fit nicely inside the cups
and its easy to adjust them for a perfect fiti have a trip coming up in a few weeks and im looking forward to putting these on and rediscovering my music collection
i wish i was leaving right nowi highly recommend you get both items in this review if you have a droid and want quality sound
without the fiio these phones are probably loud enough for most people
even on an airplane
they sound as loud to me as my tinny headphones did but without sounding crappy
like im sitting in my living room listening to a quality stereohead pad part  can be folded easily and save lots of roomand it came with extra adapter for big hole
so my daughter can use it for her digital piano and listening music from regular mp playeri dont remember how long ive owned these headphones but it has to be close to  years
the only maintenance i have done is replace the foam earpads i have treated them with care and kept them from any type of abuse
they still look almost new and still sound exceptional
more recently i bought a pair of sennheiser hd phones thinking that perhaps i would get even better quality sound
indeed the s sound very good but frankly though they sound slightly different than the vs i dont think they sound any betterthe vs have a presence and clarity which is very compelling
they can thunder the bass if need be and sail through through the high treble effortlesslythe midtones are clear and mellow
distortion is inaudible
if you are wanting to step up to audiophile quality headphones for a very reasonable amount of money i recommend the sony mdrv headphonesi bought these to use when playing electric guitar so i dont disturb  my wife and neighbors with my bad playing  i wanted something comfortable durable with a long cord
these fit the bill perfectly
they are well built fold easily and fit in a durable bag easily
the sound quality is excellent
ive heard static a couple of times when shifting the guitar but thats not the fault of the headphones
i have a medium sized head and they fit me snugly but comfortably
i can get a bit of nausea when using them but not nearly as bad as some other headphones ive triedim very satisfied with these headphones they are well worth the pricei love these things
incredibly flat response great for mixing live or in the studio
great for listening to music on my mp player
excellent build qualityive had these phones for  or  years cant acctually remember
i use them daily for long periods of listening and then ill leave them for a while and go to the stuido speakers
they still look like the same model they sell now
they are extremely accurate
will rip up a bad recording and make a good one sound everything it should
the ear pads are vinyl but under that on my was a terry cloth so i peeled the vinyl away about  years ago and they are more comfortable
i havent heard any phones that sound any better than this in my looking around
if they give out after  or  years ill get another pair in a heartbeat
but this pair are like old blue jeans to me
you wont be disappointed with this
i think you would have to shop long and hard and spend lots more to get this quality in any other model or makei was hesitant to spend  on a pair of headphones since i had always had pairs for under 
my  panasonics were great for the price and gave excellent service until the inline volume knob started having a flaky connectionafter reading the reviews on this item i went ahead and bought a pair and i am blown away by the difference in quality that extra  buys
the sonys feel very well made and they use metal and high quality plastics that make the headphones feel sturdy
i have no doubt these will last as long as the other reviewers are claimingas for the sound quality these are phenomenal
i am sure headphone purists will point out that their  grado pair blows these away but i havent heard anything in this price range that even comes closei play my bass guitar through my mixing board and it is a string model with the low string tuned to a low b my old cheaper pair of headphones would always distort when i played full volume on the low end of the b string and i thought i was overdriving the preamp on the mixing board but after plugging in the sonys i discovered it was actually the headphones
the sonys give extremely deep and clear bass reproduction all the way down to the lowest note on the bassmy only complaint is it takes about  volume on an ipod to get a reasonable listening volume compared to about  on my old headphones
however if you plug them into an amplified source such as a mixing board headphone amplifier home stereo receiver etc you should have no trouble getting good volumequality is heard here
nice fit and doesnt smash my head
i wear glasses and have a hard time finding headphones that dont hurt
sound with great and drowns out back noise welllove these light weight excellant high mid and low ouput
good frequency response
no fatigue
never realized quality of the sony mdrv until you buy them
oh
these are refurbished a steal
look new sound super
happy happy customerive sampled nearly the whole sony headphone line but the v is notable for its flattering sound and good value
while its unlikely to meet the requirements of a seasoned audiophile it will delight most everyone else with its ability to render many types of music wellthe pads are extremely comfortable
however continued use may cause the rubber to flake after several years beyer makes fine replacement pads
as youd expect from closed headphones the sound is a little closedin  but detailed enough to do justice to anything from classical to punk
these are fun headphones capable of a nice dynamic rangethe v doesnt try to emulate the sound of a concert hall or a studio rather it offers a pleasant musical experience of its own its reasonably priced they play many types of music theyre easily driven by ipods or cd players the v is aside from the pads an amazingly sturdy performerif youre picky the sound is colored that is not completely accurate they have a closedin sound  a result of their being closed phonesive since graduated to the beyer dts a notably better phone
but the v has legions of fans for obvious reasons
even people who hate sony headphones concede the vs attractive sound
theyve served me well for over a decadei got this on amazon one day sale eventthese are great headphones and in general great electronic equipment reminding me of the great sony of the s when they were making everything with great quality and absolute attention to details
the plastic is solid the cables are soft and not sticky the jacks are smooth the inner steel spring is high quality and elastic and it has small marks to click and lock the headphones opening l and r marks are different color and glued perfectly on their designated spots  etc etc
small details that are indication of how well a product was designed and made
these headphones are such a perfect producti have very large head  for example all my life i cannot find sunglasses wide enough to fit me
these headphones are elastic to stay firm and open enough to fit me without causing any discomfort for several hours
yesterday i used them non stop for  hours  they are not irritating not heating not making my ears sweat etc
i dont think they are tight at all as some other reviewers mentionedthe cord is long  definitely too long for portablegym use
these are meant to be used in static condition in a studioroomdesktop situation
sitting in a rolling chair one can move turn spin without needing to take them offsound fidelity  great
these are sounding great not colored sensitive without preamp need
on par with everything that is not pro level and costs up to 
definitely worth the moneypp
i have owned and used probably around  headphones listening from vinyls pro level studio magnetic rolls  those track ones   micro cassettes cds laser disks all kinds of computer format audio so i know about electronics
these v are worth the moneymany years ago i bought an earlier generation of these phones which i used for many years on business travel with an aiwa portable cd player to while away the hoursthey disappeared after use by four of my kids while i was between trips
this new pair is once again a superbly made and designed high fidelity gift to anyone wanting really superb soundsimply plugging them into a good receiver pumping out dvd sound and you are instantly into the world of outstanding sound from the dvd and isolated from the sounds in your environment
the bass mid and high frequencies are perfectly balanced and extend across a wider range than my large boston acoutic  speakers
after suffering with the sporadic connection failures and static in the individual plugs on the earpieces of a  sennheiser earphone set now gone into the trash im happily back with sonys v technologythe sound is better than the sennheisers when they were new
the bass in the sonys is spectacular and clean for any price range headphonesif these wear out before i do ill get another set of the same ones
as long as sony keeps making the mdrv ill keep buying themthe listing fails to mention that a very nice leatherette drawstring carrying caseis included to hold the phones and spiral wound cord when folded just like the one that came with my first set many years agofantastic range and clarity for the money
able to remixed songs with great attention to sound range separation and placementwhy buy more expensive headphones unless youre into some kind of job that requires better
this head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many many years of musical pleasure
some reviewers talk about this being a little tight on their ears and that is true but thats when they are new what i did with mine was bent them open a little bit on the sides of the headrest and that solved the problemthese are excellent and huge step up from the sony mdrv
the sound isolation is good and the headphones bring new life into your existing music collection
youll hear sounds youve never heard beforei also have the grado sr and those are very good openear phones
these are just as good in terms of sound quality
they are also a significant step up from my previous sony mdrv which i didnt like and the foam deteriorated quicklyi highly recommend it
as usual amazon delivery was quick and arrived before my tripim no audiophile but these are noticeably awesome
fantastic audio quality all around at a very fair price
highly recommendedmy sisters bose headphones finally died and so her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the highend stuff i gave her my jvc harx and she loves them even more than the bose
so that left me with nothing and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under  that i could
i looked at so many headphones and i still loved my jvcs but i decided i should probably try something new
and then i found thesei would say that i aman untrainedaudiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones
i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to but it doesnt exactly bother me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh etc
that being said i loved my jvcs and was sad to see them go but ive gotta say i love these bad boys even more
i think its the bass that separates themits punchier and moreaccurate you know
without being overly done
out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance i think thats the right word but theyve broken in a bit and its less harsh in that range
but the basswow
otherwise theyre very similar in my opinion to the jvcs
the treble might be a tad better but not much if at all
i dont know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it but thats my two cents
theyre also very comfortable not too tight or anything and very soft padding
i highly recommend them i cant imagine headphones getting that much better
ive heard beats by dre bose and the jvcs and these are just the best of all of them to mei bought these cans after reading loads of review
i am not disappointedthese are the best headphones ive ever owned
they are great for everything from opera to electronic music
youll hear every detail in the recording including the noise that maybe there
the sound is present flat as in honest and livelythis review is aimed at those with eyeglasses and whose ears get pinched between the eyeglass arms and the earphones
i do not like to block up my ears with ear plugs all day for health concerns
i have bought and used thesesony mdrcdsony mdrvsony mdrxdmy ears are not real fussy on quality nearly all headphones give my ears a problem by pressing them against my eyeglass arms and this hurts usually after  minutes of listening
my hatsize if about my ears are pretty normal in size i am middle aged
all three of these headphones i own are the best i have tried on or read reviews by eyeglass wearers over past  years
headphones have a left and right side  the cord typically is attached to the left side and the ear spaces or cups are oriented accordingly to that the back of the ear lobe has more space to sit in than the front of the ear lobe
the sideways pressure how hard they clamp onto your head also is a secondary factor in whether my ears hurt
i wear wireframe glasses and my use for headphones is background music while i program the cd is no longer available that i could find fall  and ive used them for  years
they hurt my ears after  hours of continual use but are good before that
they have cloth covered ear cushions and relatively deep ear lobe spaces
this feature in all earphone seems to be the primary feature that determines whether my ears hurt or not
if you can find these and like cloth covered headphones you wont be unhappy
the sideways pressure is light for me the v stands out for  things  richness and accuracy of the sound and blocking out outside office noises
listening to classical music not real loud a coworker can speak to my face and his voice is muffled pretty well
womens voices too
overheard conversations are not overheardi have used these occaisionally for a couple months and my earshead get sore after  hours
the sideways pressure is noticeably more than the other two but not excessive
they are well cushioned with soft fake thin leatherlike vinyl which i did not find causes sweating at all
but there is not a large space for the ear lobes to sit and this is what causes pressure after a while to build up uncomfortably i am sure
if i did not have my eyeglasses on then these are very comfortable the xd is a little lighter than the v it does not block out outside noises as well which can be a benefit in the office because i can hear coworkers calling my name
the sideways pressure is light the cushion is the same thickneess as the v but the ear space is much deeper for the earlobe so for this reason it is the most comfortable of all headphones ive owned or tried
the cushions are covered in the thin leatherlike vinyl like the v  this stuff feels like a paper much more than a plastic it feels dry not clammy
to my unprofessional ears the sound is great
if you wear eyeglasses dont want to use ear plugs for hours at a stretch then i think you will be happiest with the sony mdrxd headphonesthese sound great once they break in
i can wear them for hours without fatigue and theyre built like tanks compared to some others on the marketand i have never found a superior pair of headphones periodthey are comfortable with one small adjustment
they have fantastic sound
and for the price almost always less than a hundred bucks sometimes much less even if they do fail or wear out which they almost never do theyre easily replacedi cant handle inear buds  my canals are too small and they always hurt
onear headphones are a joke
these are perfection
that one small adjustment i mentioned
get a pair of beyerdynamic edt  velour replacement pads and suddenly these headphones become the last pair youll ever needno question this product is full on  star material
i received a pair of these phones in  maybe  not sure as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle
since receiving them i have taken them with me all over the world
ive slept with them on my head on  hour flights i have slept with them in my bed they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggagenot only do these things sound incredible they obviously hold up very well considering the abuse i have heaped upon mine and they are still working and sounding perfectly after these eighteen  years
i am in awe of theirawesomenessi have replaced the ear pads once with these beyer dynamic velour pads highly recommended btw  im  years old and wondering if i will be willing these things to one of my childrennice sound without burning a hole in your pocket
i also have yamaha pro  both are good
sound qualityof both is very close but each has its own distinct quality
i like the yamaha one being lighter but it costs a lot morei just switch between themthats what these headphones create for me
the sound quality is nothing less than awesome from deep welldefined bass to clear midrange sade billy joel and etta james just sound divine
to sharp but not overbearing highs
the dynamic range is astoundingyoull hear little details in songs you never noticed beforeim sure you could find better headphones for a lot more money
but unless you have the hearing of a dog youre not going to notice enough of a difference to make the extra hundred dollars or so worth your while
if youre willing to spend some dough but not wanting to pay a mint these are highly recommendedmy only caveat is that the fit is a little snug
in a way its good because it helps keep background noise out without the distortion that noise cancellation can introduce
these are ideal for noisy environments where you want to be alone with your sound
but i could see where individuals with wider than average heads might experience a bit of discomfort with prolonged use
if i take my glasses off while wearing these headphones i generally have to take the headphones off to put my glasses back on
but then again eyeglasses and headphones are always an awkward mixunbelievable headphonesalthough they may hurt on your head after  minutes the sound quality makes them worth it i love these headphones
they fell really good on your ears they are made of that soft like material and the compression on your head is not bad at alloh the sound yeah they rocki am  satisfied with this purchase
if these disappeared i would buy a replacement set immediatelythe build quality is top notch much better than youd expect from the photo
other headphones have chinsy hinges or oversized plastic hinges to appear that they are built well but when you feel these in your hands you will know that they will last
the cord and plug are both pro grade alsothe audio quality is great
are there better sounding phones
maybe
ive had some very expensive sennheisers sonys a few random off brands and a pair of grados all which sounded great
these sonys hang with them
if you can find a pair that sounds better that pair will be  and it wont blow these sonys out of the water but just barely edge them out on a few detailscomfort is good
the foam goes fully around your earcircumaural and they are a closed can design so they block out outside sounds
they arent noise isolating or noise reducing but they block enough to put you in your own audio space
if you listen with these you wont hear the phone ringing in the other room
if you have sweaty ear syndrome or dont like headphones that are closed these might not be up your alley
that is only a preference though and not a ding against these headphones
i personally really like the closed circumaural design
the band and the ear pressure are exactly right
in ten years after youve worn through the ear pads replacements will still be readily available onlineoverall these are the industry standard for a reason
time tested excellent quality unbeatable value
buy these headphones you will be satisfied with them for suregreat sound
comfortable on head and ears
ears do get warm after a  minute movie
i hope they last a long timethese are the best headphones that ive ever owned
i am prone to headaches i work in a loud environment and i like high quality sound
these overear headphones block out a lot of noise dont squeeze too tightly on my head and have incredible sound quality
i am very happygreat sound quality great value
highly recommend them
i used to break headphones all the time  pair every  months now these have lasted me at least a yeargreat value
just buy themtheres not much to say other than the sound is great and the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time
highly recommendedthe headphones i just purchased replaced a faithful pair ive had now for  years
now that i have the new pair i can definitely say that over the years the old ones lost a lot of bass even though ive replaced the ear pads and the new pair sounds like i remember the old ones sounding when they were new
all the bass is there all the highs and definitely all the midrange
the musical detail is extraordinary
i count on these headphones to hear things up close and personal when im doing productions and have never found a pair that sounded anywhere near what i get from these
glad i was still able to get a pair of these vs
theyre  in my bookamazing headphone value
if you want big booming bass pick up a set of vmoda crossfades
if you want to hear subtle nuances in your music which you never new were there before then these are the phones for you
very light and incredibly comfortable to boot
quite honestly i cant imagine how someone could complain that these give a tight fit
i generally use these with my nuforce icon dac google play music and my toshiba chromebook
however i think they shine the best when using the dac along with my onkyo cas an armature to the hifi sound devices i have no complain about it so far
it is an excellent product on every aspects in terms of comfortableness construction quality sound quality and etcafter retracted the whole thing is bit of bulky
it is not a portable product for carrying around in your backpack
also rigid and cheaper looking leather bag is not a match for this earphone
id rather to have a soft cloth bag for itive used more than a few headphones over the years including some sennheiser pro studio models
the sennheiser are typically uncomfortable after an hour or two so if you plan to spend time at a board they can be painful and depending on how long you where them the pain can last a day or two
the sony v headset is very comfortable enough so that ive used them all night well actually all day and night without experiencing much discomfort and the sound in my opinion is superior to anything ive tried recently
in the last few years ive switched to using earbuds for most of my casual listening and simply had forgotten how great a decent full size headset soundsover all ive found this set to be very true reproducing recorded music and are better than anything ive used in the sub  price range
one test ive used to compare sound reproduction in the past is to listen to a clean recording of a few acoustic instruments especially the sound of a piano
if a headset can reproduce the timber and resonance of a full size piano theyre usually a good bet
being a acoustic string guy i also look at how well a set will reproduce the sound of a high end acoustic guitar mandolin and violin
if they are accurate on those simple tests then i would grab them
this set does a fantastic job of reproducing the sound of everything i listen for with exceptional precision
i paid a lot more than a  for my sennheiser but this set sounds better and is much more comfortable to wear even for short periods of timei would highly suggest anyone looking at these give them a try and see for yourselves just how good these sound
the range from  hz khz should be ample for anyone though the bass is not exaggerated it is clean tight and powerful enough for myself anyway
honestly these would be a very good choice for home studio or for casual listening and if youve been spending hundreds on earbuds you have to give these a try year old audio engineer video shootereditor former radio host
i used s for my video shoots for many years
they are wonderful
these vs are every bit as great
light comfy straight excellent sound
if youre gonna get a cramp because it doesnt have a red pro sticker on the side get s
if you want equally great headphones at steal of a price buy the vs here youll be very happyget these phones and live happily ever afteri bought these because i was looking for a nice pair of headphones that sounded as good as the ones i remembered using as a kid when i had to listen to music through headphones while not disturbing my parents watching tv
little did i know that sony still makes the same model
thats right some  years later i now own my own pair of the exact same headphones
if the fact that sony still makes the same headphones without any changes doesnt say enough about these then nothing i say would do much justice but ill try anywayi have a  head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly i bought them anyway
once i got them i did notice they are a bit tight but since i have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on this is not a concern to me
plus in time i expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use
the padding on the ears are very nice but i can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying but that would probably happen with anything you put onin your earsonce on i cant think of any other headphones ive tried that sound as good
for my desktop speakers i use aklipsch promedia  thx certified computer speaker system blackthat sounds amazing when playing songs through itunes or pandora so i needed something better than the apple earphones i was using when i didnt want to blast out my roommates
the mdrv headphones do just that
of course they dont have the same punch as a floored subwoofer but surprisingly the bass in these headphones is quite noticeableuntil i bought these i wasnt even really using the itunes equalizer
now as i change music i change the eq because the headphones make you hear sounds youve never heard before
i feel like going back through all my music just to see what ive been missingthese are a great pair for the price  cheaper than the mdri have just started listening to the vs and have had the mdrs for a little over a yearhonestly you get what you pay for most of the time except for the mdr  and v cans
they both are undeniable stars in the headphones scenethe difference between the v and mdr is very small but there is a difference both in sound maybe my vs just need to break in but i generally dont believe in the break in process for speakersthe mdr from the very beginning were absolutely amazing
very natural sounding great ability to pick out little details in well recorded music
i loved listening to some of the eagles stuff on them they have some crisp clean string sounds and well recorded drums
they are loose fitting on the ears somewhat keeps your ears feeling free and comfortable
the cable is very good rubber limber and returns to its shape over a few minutes if left in a knot or stretched outthe vs have an almost equally amazing sound more bass response than the mdr
seems that they lack just very so slightly the clarity of the mdr
earpads are more of a matt finish and firmer than the s
the cable on these is no doubt quality and will last years under normal circumstances but the nice factor is not the same feel
the actual plug is just like that on the  same screw on  adapter but the shell is nickel finished instead of black and the contacts on the plug are nickel plated instead of gold plated
nickel is actually preferable against popular belief because a majority of the jacks it will be plugged into in its life will have nickel plated contacts and dissimilar metals will corrode when touching
not really a problem in a clean dry studio but the ideal thing is always to be kept in mindin the end if youre looking for good headphones for studio or engineering of some kind go with the  if youre doing an at home studio or just want bang for the buck to plug into your ipod the vs are where its ati originally bought these headphones to go with our digital piano but my wife didnt see any need for them so they became my computer headphones
darn di want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head yet are firm enough to not fall off
sound quality is extremely important to me not just blasting bass or highs or anything
these have excellent fidelity
you can hear the highs the lows and the mids very clearly on this set and one is not overpowered by the others
one thing i have noticed about lowerend headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music or games or movies some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply cannot handle that many streams simultaneously
these headphones do not have that problem
after reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years i look forward to a long relationship with thesei listen to a wide variety of music and everything from linkin park to mozart sounds great on these headphones as well as a wide variety of pc games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival to fps games with explosions and gunshots
i have noticed with these phones i feel like i have my  system on and have to take them off to ensure i am not being obnoxious to my neighbors only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that i am hearing
the same thing happened with our digital piano i thought i was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them but that was not the case
anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations or they do not know what sound quality isupdate so i wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction
i have put them on when i sat down at my computer only to realize an hour later i was still wearing them and not listening to any music
they are comfortable enough to forget that they are on and the are noise cancelling enough that they literally cut the noise levels in the room in half
i continue to love themi had a pair of sennheiser hd s i believe man these things destroy them
first of all they arent tight at least on my head so they rest comfortably
second the sound quality is amazing
no wonder theyve had these cans selling for decades
if you have an eq on your pc then you can raise the bass a little if youre feeling frisky lol
i use them for some mxing and casual listening and theyre great so far
anyway with that said these headphones are great and at  when i bought it they rival a lot foof the higher end headphone
definitely in my recommendation for a good set of headphonesanother positive review for this surprising its relatively cheap compared to other budget headphones
nothing more to add than whats already said this one is definately one to add to your collection even if this is the only one in your collectionthese headphones are great
they give what some people call a flat soundjust the way an acoustical instrument woud sound in a room without an echo
in other words no excentuated highs basses or midrange
they are ruggedly constructed for professional use
they are also pretty comfortable with one slight drawback
the plastic padding around each phone fits so snugly around my ears that my ears eventualy get a little too warmbuy them
you wont be sorryi bought these headphones to use at home and at church
i am involved in the multimedia ministry at my church and these really do a great job
you wont be disappointed if you get themfirst bought these back in  along with a sony diskman with my first paycheck
these headphones have been used along with my sony diskman ipods gen   and  home stereo and gaming pcs since i got them
it has outlived most of the tech i had plugged them into and kept on kicking until a friend stole them
bought a replacement pair in  on amazon and just got around to reviewing themthese headphones sound great when i first bought them and still do now
they opened my ears to cleaner sounds when listening to music that default electronic headphones dont pick upi have taken these with me while riding the bus long car trips and on the airplane
they can be compacted to be taken on the go and stuffed in a bag
so they are very portable even come with a leatherish bag to be carried in
they are very comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time
even taken long naps and slept with them over night
they do make your head warm after extended hours of use but that goes for any over the ear headphones
they are very adjustable you can wear them on one ear and the other behind the head and wont fell like your head is in a viceonly problem i ever had with them is that the earpads start to flake off after a while
but you can get replacement pads that dont flake
but i cant knock the rating down for that since i had these for such a long time and since it has outlived several gaming headsets just to get plugged back inso sweet and sublime there isnt anything here that shouldnt be
great separation and pure rich sound as it was intended
awesome flavored with oldschool cool
buy a pair and find out for yourself
rock oni spend at least  hours a week in these mixing music professionally
ive owned mine since the late s and have two pair one for home and one for work
ive replaced the earpads about every  yearsthese are quite simply one of the best ten products ive ever owned
the sound quality is unparalleled
they are efficient enough to be driven loud from a computer or an ipod
i have a super large head and these are very comfortable
those of you complaining they are too tight dont understand how to adjust them  pull the earpieces down if they are too tightive never found a better pair at any price
the fact that these are under  last essentially forever and sound superb is a modern miracleflat frequency response as high as any human ear can hear and lower than most any equipment can produce and yet the sound is pleasing from just about any sourcebuy a pair of them without hesitation
youll never regret itive bought two pairs of these now only because one was a gift to my dad
theyre the best sounding ive used for the budget and budgets hundreds higher
just know the ear pad will start to fall apart after awhile i think it was around two years for mebought these because of their range
glad i did
only problem i have is the cord
it may be  feet long but because its coiled you really are limited to where you can go
go too far and out comes the plug or down goes the stereo
just need to limit your range
no biggie
i just move the chair closer to the stereoalso the cushions are fit just right around my ears where they do a good job of blocking out outside noisesthese are by far the best headphones ive ever owned
sony got it right when they invented the mdrvs and thats why theyve stayed pretty much the same even the packaging for about  years
id recommend them to anyoneand terrific sound
you dont need to spend  on the good doctors  prescription 
these are a very wise economical and sound worthy choicebased on all the recommendations on amazon and around the internet this was the best model at my target price
the product actually exceeded my expectations
the sound is superior and the headset is very comfortable
as expected sony has not had to update this model for years because you cant improve upon perfection at this price pointi like this headset sound quality was greatnotecord is long no i mean really longit has an adapter for the large audio jackthey are adjustable for sizethe ear pads are nice and softthese have become the preferred headphones of choice for tracking
i wasnt expecting much when i picked up a pair of these on black friday for 
ive had numerous people google these after using them to see where they can get them in town quicker
these are the real dealits not a solid  star but it still deserves it
at this price the sound quality is wonderful
i did burnin with an app on android using pink noise
before the burnin the sound is good but not smooth enough
now it just sounds right
the sound is much smoother
good build quality
nicely packaged
a decent leather bag is includednow the cons or insufficiency dont expect light weight but it is ok cable is telephone wire maybe good for moving around in studio but ugly and unnecessary for other use the can doesnt hug your head tightly
it is comfy for home use but you probably cant go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snailoverall a great quality headphone for the price
try it with flacape against other can you will feel the great sound qualityi purchased these on black friday i use them for my ipod touch th generation
the sound these produce completely removed the need to use any eq settings on my ipodi mostly listen to pop rock and rap so i can say highs are great mids are good bass is excellent and clearand no noise distortioni cant speak to how well the build of the headphones will last overtime but so far they seem durablethey are a good choice if you plan on owning a high quality or audiophile version of headphonesthe only thing i absolutely hate is the longgggggg cable
i cant work it with it it dangles over my legsjumps up and down with me
if sony could make a short version cable these would easily destroy beats souls audio technica and all of the otherhighly marketed headphonessanta brought me these after i had done some extensive research
ive always been content spending a little extra money for quality and peace of mind these headphones are one of the rare occurrences when you can get an incredible product at an extremely reasonable price
lightweight comfortable and sturdily built headphones with an incredibly balanced sound
bass is very accurate and complements vocals and instruments nicely
find myself wearing these for hours on end with no irritation although clearly head and ear shape vary greatly the mdrv will be a steady companion of mine for the foreseeable futurethe sound that these headphones reproduces is simply amazing
right away i was astonished by the vast details crisp vocals and all the little details that was intended to be heard by the artistfor under  this is one of the best in that price range it even sounds better than some higher priced headphonesthis definitely sounds better than my beats and bose headphonesthese headphones are also very comfortable feels much more durable than beats and bosebased on other reviews it seems that these headphones will last a long timebuy it dont hesitate you wont regret iti record interview audio for videodslr shoots professionally
my goto system begins with a sennheiser mkht short shotgun mic into a sound devices  mixer which can power the tpower mic the linein into a juicedlink rm then into a nikon d then recording to the hdmi output to an atomos ninjato monitor i plug my trusty mdrvs into the monitor out of the  mixer which is listening via its return to the headphone output of the nikon
with a knob turn i can then listen to any of the mixers three inputs directly or to the cameras return confidence feedif it sounds good in the sony mdrvs itll sound good in the edityes there are way more expensive headphones but i know how the mdrvs sound i trust them and they never breakthe biggest problem is coworkers borrowing them and not returning them
write your name on them in large lettersgreat quality in sound and are quite durable
we use a pair at work to monitor camera sound during interviews and it blocks exterior noise well without completely blocking off sound so you can still hear your fellow crewfolds down to a manageable size and comes with a cheapo leather pouch that does the job
for the  or so bucks i paid for it i really cant find anything wrong with it or any reason to go for a more expensive modelif you want beats headphones take the stickers off the side and use a white sharpie and write a bgood set of features for the price for sureeverywhere you find quality reviews of these headphones including audiophile sites the v ranks highly
they sound great for all kinds of music as well as for monitoring audio during video editing
probably not suited for audio mixing as these phones are made for great sound not the sort of flat response youd probably want for mixingthese phones sit on top of my ears and as other reviewers have noted they can get a bit warm and little too snug after a couple hours of wearing them
however i dont wear them too long in any one sitting so it doesnt bother mebought for my daughter for her sound engineering class
they are versatile  types of connection for home and studio
great sound high and low frequency and buffer ambient sound pretty well
highly recommend
not the best money can buy but a good dealhave you been considering good headphones
have you searched the net and headfi looking for advice
look no further
if you want open headphones choose the sennheiser px or grado sr or sr
if you want closed there is no better choice under  than the mdrv
beware the other sony models  they have a few good ones but most are not so good even a few that are pricier than this one
this is the same headphone except for cosmetics as the mdrgreat soundeasy to drive with or without an ampdurablecomfortabledo not hesitate  you wont regret theseupdate these are still great but shure has since introduced two models the srh and  that are very nice and worth a listen some will certainly prefer them to the sony
the  is very close in price as well
also worth considering is the denon ahd and d which when on sale are around 
the denons have great sound perhaps slighlty more appealing to me than the sony but the denon has absolutely the best comfort in any headphone that sounds decent and is under 
the sony wins on ruggedness and value though and the sound isnt worlds apartfor studio monitoring you cant go wrong with these
the sennheiser hd  pro are a heftier build have a flatter response and all parts are replaceable but its good to have more than one tool in this area
this being my second pair of sony mdrv my son destroyed my original pair in an electronic music class after he borrowed them i found sonically i was missing something by just using the sennhiesers
the sonys have deeper bass and an extended high end which makes them more musical
the quality for the price can not be beat
in fact for listening to music i would recommend these over any other headphone under 
you have to trust so many positive reviews these are classicsaddendum i added the beyer dynamic padded ear cushions and these headphones are a lot more comfortable
i noticed immediately that the bass response went way up maybe not such a good thing for critical monitoring and mixing
im just wondering why
i did notice when i took the original sony pads off there is an additional layer albeit thin of foam behind the velour
perhaps this is why
also as often discussed headphones get a sweeter sound after about a  to  hour break in period
the sonys definitely get smoother with agethese headphones are amazing
the sound quality is great
neutral to some extent
the bass is true the midrange is strong and the treble is clear
the supplied  inch to  inch adapter lets you use your headphones on your home theater setup
these headphones can really handle all the power from your amplifier and can actually benefit when you start adjusting the soundthe stock earpads are okay
i bought the beyerdynamic pads which are way more comfortable than the supplied ones
plus they add a bit more bass which is greatthese cans have the reputation of being extremely tough
i cant really say much about that since ive owned them for a couple of months barely
but im hoping to get some years from thesegood value for the money
very nice sound quality and comfortable to wear for long periodsi find myself in agreement with almost everyone else
i lay no claim to having an educated ear but i have anyones subjective ability to distinguish better sound quality from not so good sound quality
these headphones are definitely in the better categoryi bought these phones to wear during keyboard practice so i wouldnt annoy others in the room
i quickly found they were so good that i started plugging them into the laptop when i wanted to watch a flick or listen to something on line
i imagine they will replace every other pair or headphones or earbuds in the housei dont have comfort issues with them but am sometimes annoyed at their tendency to fold up when i take them off for a moment
id rather fold my own headphones thank you not have a spring system do it for meold guy alert im closer to  than  and i have the usual agerelated highend hearing deficiency
in the real world i can barely hear the top two or three notes on a piano
through these headphones the tones are still faint but clearer
i take that to mean that the overear pads are screening out some of the aural clutter that will bury all but the loudest high tones for meall in all very satisfiedi bought  different sets of headphones and this is the set i ended up keeping
these are comfy sound great and feel like they will stand up to my daily uses
did i mention they sound awesomeover  years ago i had started working at circuit city and i wanted to buy a good pair of headphones especially since i got an employee discount of store cost
  i tried on all the headphones on the rack not listening to anything i just snapped my fingers and listened to how well each headphone muffled the sound
the sony mdrv pair did the best job
based on that i bought them
imagine my shock when i listened to them and realized that they gave me better sound than my actual speakers did
over the  years since then the padding disintegrated and in my last move they got um
a bit crunched
i was heartbroken as i remember sony replacing the v with a far lesser pair of v headphones
they had i thought renamed the v and tripled the price
not so apparently
i found my current pair of vs right here on amazon for the exact price id paid for them at cost remember back in 
 edit i bought them for sixty dollars both times ive seen them go  higher on amazon but as long as they are less than a hundred they are still worth it
if you have any desire to hear your music without distraction if you want the headphones that professionals use if you want to have sounds coming at you that you cannot even hear but more feel then buy these headphonesthe sound quality is unparalleled in its price range
even going double or triple the price does not guarantee you a better pair of headphones but there are some at higher prices
point is you dont need to go that high for topquality phones
the foot cord may seem like overkill but when you need to get up from your chair to close that window or answer the phone you left on the cradle on the other side of the room or to look out the front window to see whatever you will appreciate not being tethered
those ten feet equal freedom of movement that couples with phenomenal soundthe phones even let you do that little thing you see professionals do in those shows where they flip an earpiece over and hold it up to their ear without putting the band over their head
or flip one while its over your head to enable a friend to listen to what youre listening toi have read some people saying that these phones are uncomfortable
i cannot imagine how that is possible
the padding is quite comfortable if shortlived in the earpads and they manage to be snug without being constrictingthese are of course not headphones to be worn while exercising unless you really want your ear pads soaked in sweat
but that aside these honesttogoodness studio monitors will faithfully reproduce any sound you can throw at them and never give you distortion from having the music turned up too loud
you may go deaf from it  but it wont be distortedi love these i went through a couple of headphones before i found these and i had planned to try as many as possible until i found the ones i was completely happy with well i stopped
i tried the jvc black series and a couple of bose and none of them sounded like what i was looking for not that they where bad just not what i was looking for
these sound exactly like what i had in mind the sound is very clear and crisp im hearing parts of my music that i never even knew where there
i listen to a lot of different genres rap rb rock and hip hop to name a few
everything sounds great the only thing about these is that if your looking for thumping bass these arent for you not that they dont have bass its just not thumping bass but definitely there
before you go and spend over a  on bose or anything else i would give these a look you wont regret itthe quality of sound from these phones is fantastic
easily setup wonderful soundthanksif you want better sound get the mm versions mdr
anyway this is what we use in professional studios
aint nothing expensive to buy
how do you like thatthis is what the record you are listening to was mastered withi have tested bose around ear headphones not the noise canceling version and my sony mdrv beat bose by farbose got a softer cushion and better response in the very low frequency at hz but sony are far more consistent with the output level throughout the entire response range hz on sony sound all at almost the same level  very nice flat response sony have indeed
it will let you hear all the things in your tracks the good and the bad of mastering  you can hear them all on sonys
but with bose the bass will sound better and that is it  nothing elsei am so happy i got the mdrv instead of bose
when i got my sony both were almost same pricehave tried jvc and others but sony is the best for home recording studio and other uses including watching showsbought these head phones for my wife
she uses them when she flies they fold up nice and they have better sound quality  than the ones i have that are a lot more expensive
next ones i buy will be the sonysive had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment
i use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality much better than the earbuds i was using before
the included carrying case is another bonus as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a planethe classic sony mdrcd headphones that i got back in held together with duct tape string and super gluefinally fell apart after  years of useand countless ear pad replacements
i used other brands and sony models over the years and nothing came close to thisuncolored accurate sound and especially its tightnot exaggeratedbass response
until i discovered the mdrv which ive heard has been around almost as long as the mdrcd
the only difference is that the mdrv is more comfortable as it completely encloses my ears the mdrcd pads were smaller and rested on my ears not around them
this is an excellent value for the moneyi have always had a pair of headphones usually purchased at best buy or something similar
i used to think price quality
turns out in the audio universe that just isnt true
these headphones are really great for the price and even for a  pair of headphoneslook bottom line is these are marvelous headphones
but connected to your laptop or other digital source you will be missing out on so much audio quality
everything either needs to be analog or you need a semi highquality usb dac
do some research because given the proper signals these headphones will really blow your mind
and take all these reviews with a grain of salt
one reviewer might be basing their review on what they sound like on an ipod and another might be reviewing on a k audiophile setupi love music and demand great sound quality in my headphones
with that said the mdrv monitor headphones are the stuff of legend
theyve been making these babies for well over a decade and as far as i know their quality has always stayed true
they have stood the test of time and will give you the most bang for buck compared to any other model
and when you see how these are packaged youll see that sony still has much pride in their product
there are so many reasons why i think these headphones are a true classic but i dont want to reiterate what thousands if not millions have already said about these through the years
if youre in the market for great monitor headphones for a very reasonable price dont hesitate to buy these
you wont be disappointedprosamazing and balanced soundfor what youre getting these headphones are truly a great valuelong cord  foot cordlarge headphone adapter includedgreat build quality they should last you for many years and even then youll probably only need to change the ear padsconsnone except that i wish they were indestructible but thats not gonna happen and unrealistic ive had other headphones around this price range in the past but they did not come close to how great this set of cans sound
i did my research and just wanted for this baby to go on sale and i wasnt left hanging
the sound is sharp and clear and just enough bass for me
im not really into how the beats headphone are so overpowering when it comes to bass but thats just me
if you want to hear all the detail in the music at a reasonable price this will not disappoint   
i once had bad headphones but now i hear 
taking this to churchi tried many different headphones looking for flat response and detailed sound
i also did not want to pay hundreds of dollars
these are the one
these excel from low to high frequencies
bass is full but not overwhelming
highs are exceptionally detailed
mids are just right
i can listen to the music for hours now without fatigue
one will not find such high quality headphones for this price
other sony slightly cheaper studio headphones mdrvv are terrible
more expensive are not better
these are just rightfinding the right set of headphones to suit my taste for soundboard monitoring has been an issue  until now
these are the real deal
the only point i give these four stars instead of the full five is the cord
its long and somewhat bulky but manageable
the sound reproduction particularly at the bass end is surprisingly good and the overall fit is perfectdont bother looking further
ive done it and tried most of them
id put these up against anything else even more expensive brands on the marketi have had dozens of headphones these work well with my ipod
i will leave sonic reviews to others but i do not like booming and distorted bass such as with the extremely overpriced imo beats headphones
the v seems to be a good value with fairly flat response and reasonable sensitivityi have a large head and these are comfortable to me
sound isolation is good much better than i thought it would be given the comfort and sizeafter reading about the pad wear i will try periodic cleaning with a vinyl conditioner
i ordered these with a coiled cord which is a heavier than a straight cord so pay attention when ordering if cord type is important to youtheres not much to say here others havent said  these are just fantastic neutralsounding and comfortable headphonesif you want emphasized bass or crackling highs  especially in noisy places like outdoors and on public transit  these might sound too flat for you  youre going to want some mtx ixs or something like that
if you prefer a softer natural sound or if you are doing production work these are probably what you want
theyll last you a long time in a studio or bedroom toopackaging is a little excessive but it does give the headphones a luxury feel
the headphones themselves are very comfortable even with the pleather
theyre actually really compact compared to many cans at this price
lows mids and highs are all excellent for under 
the build quality is nothing less than superb as expected doesnt feel plasticy or vulnerable to breakage at all
need time to break in these new cans but i can say that these are similar to the hds but the sonys are more comfortable and less costly
i recommend these to anyone looking for affordable headphones for music or monitoring in generalbest headphones on earth
i actually confused some of the sounds on the records i was listening to for real sounds in my room
xd the bass really comes out and its so rich and distinct
it really had made me fall deeper in love with musicheadphones exist to provide a provide listening experience  so as not to blast others with your music or whatever and to isolate the environmentive had several headphones over the years  the koss proa sony mdr v and some miscellaneous inear typesthe koss proa finally wore out and i figured i would try something lighterthe mdr v was a good choice comfortable lightweight and good fidelity at least to my aging toomanyyearsonaflightdeck hearing and aged gracefully if not well
the problems with the liner are well documentedhowever my son grabbed them to wear when playing his online games and that was thatso i went shopping for a new pair and decided to try the mdr vim impressedsome reviewers consider them uncomfortably tight but im fine and i have a large head
the cushions are reasonable soft and provide good isolationits the fidelity that blows me away for the price
the volume is good again too many years on a carrier deck i need volume and the bass is smooth and rich without being obnoxious
the higher frequencies are clear and sharp without abrasive characteristicsthe adapter is the smaller  that is common to ipads phones notebooks etc
a bonus is a nice  jack that doesnt just snap onto the smaller one but screws on tight
nice quality touchfor the price
excellent and highly recommendedits like a classic headphone but can beat many modern day headphone in terms of sound reproduction and qualitydefinitely wont regret owning thiswhen i bought this i thought i had bought a set of gold plated diamond necklace
sony packaged it like it was a limited edition
i paid  bucks for headphones that were mediocre before and this is only around   very solid sound and great for monitoring i thought about needing a  dollar pair of sennheiser but a colleague said you wont get more out of a more expensive set than this
im not sure whats the difference between this and mdr but i can only image how awesome the professional ones are thoughi bought these for a trifecta purpose  i can use them while recording music  i can have overtheear cans to listen to my mps  so i can enjoy music againim not single anymore havent been for a long time and i dont have the setup that i used to have in order to listen to music at the volume i enjoyed
nor do i drive my car often enough to be able to listen to much more than a few tracks at a time
then my wife complains if i turn my music up past  on the volume knob
so i pretty much fell out of the music listening loop over the years
music was and has been a huge part of my life and i miss it
now with these cans i can lock myself in the basement sit back and be that dude on the old memorex packaging being blown away in his chair
these things make music sound so much better than it does coming through any loudspeaker
its like youre right there with it
these arent even on the same playing field as earbuds and those expensive dre beats headphones suck compared to these
after comparing the two im so glad i didnt waste my money on beats
i will likely buy a few more pairs of these so i dont have to keep transferring them from one device to the next
and i took the advice of other reviewers and picked up thebeyerdynamic edt  velour padded earcushions for dt dt sony mdr and v headphones pairto replace the ones that came on it
they are much more comfortable and dont cause your ears to sweat nearly as bad as the ones that come on itif you are a true music aficionado you will not regret this purchasei bought a pair for record monitoring about  years ago and liked them so much i bought a second set before they were discontinued
the retailer i got them from is long gone but these babies are still available
not that i need them they still function perfectly
i keep one on the computer and one on the stereo
they are not the best sounding cans ive heard as i own a set of stax
but they are the best monitors ive ever used
a little hotharsh above khz but thats what you need to hear what youve got
they can smell any clipping
the stax earpads have gotten flaky but these sonys have aged well
they get dropped ripped off my head etc
all the time no problem
they fold up compactly in a travel pouch and plug into anything
i wear them for hours comfortably
i have other sonys sennheisers beyers and others that i cant listen to anymore because of these
there is no better value that i know ofit sounds great
and over the last year it has proven to be quite sturdy
easy to store in the bag that it comes with
i highly recommend itwonderful
the specs looked great
after receipt i tried them out with my  star itunes playlist
i had been using etymotics ear buds but wanted a longer cord and an over the ear style
the sony beat them hand downs
i had originally ordered a pair of audiotechnica 
to me the audiotechnica muffled the bass sounds a bit and didnt give me the crisp highs that i had expected or was used to
i returned those and ordered the sony mdrv about  and couldnt be happier
better than the etymotic ear buds  solid bass  but not too much and nice crisp highs
also they are a bit more comfortable than the audiotechnica and a lot less expensive
the sonys are solidi was going to buy the professional alternative of these headphones so before i did i read some of the reviews and there wasnt much of a difference i believe the only difference was the  plug is gold plated and this one isnt but these headphones are worth every penny
i use it for video editing and they rock hardi just got these recently after reading all the reviews here
the others arent lying these headphones are unbelievable
i find them extremely comfortable and dont think they feel heavy like others have said
the build quality is top notch and feel like they could last for the  years that others haveas far as the sound goes they seem to do better with real music than fake
basically if youre listening to classical jazz acoustic vocals or classic rock i cant imagine anything could ever reproduce sound better
ive listened to led zeppelin for  years and now im relistening hearing and feeling subtle sounds i never heard before
theyll almost bring you to tears as you go back and listen to your favorite albumswhere they seem to fail is with fake music such as rap hip hop or anything else created with synthesizers or computers
if that sort of nonmusic is your thing you may be better off with the dre headphones
if real music is what you listen to you absolutely have to buy thesegreat sound and comfortable
i have not experienced the discomfort many other reviewers mentioned as a con in their reviews
i use these with my high definition audio recorder and can hear every detail
ive also used them to listen to music and have found them to be quite a pleasureif i were to nitpick id say the coiled cord is a bit cumbersome due to its weight
if youre using this with a small device such as i do with my zoom h audio recorder it will definitely need some care so it doesnt tip the device over or pull it off a table
not a huge problem and not really a con for mefirst of all i was nearly dissuaded from purchasing these because of complaints about tightness
anyone who says these are tight probably never wore real headphones before
depending on how pampered your ears are you may need more padding but thats it
sound quality is superior and the fact these fold up so nicely make them excellent if you travel
as long as sony makes these i doubt i will buy another brandmodeli bought these headphones on amazon for the great price of  bucks and let me tell you it was money well spent
they sound fantastic and feel very comfortable after watching  hour long movies or listening to long music sessions while working around the housekeep in mind like most headphones they require time to burn in out of the box the highs sounded off and bass was mediocre
after a week of listening the headphones sound fantastic and keep getting better
remember this when purchasing these headphones
if you can get them for the  bucks i got them then i promise you will enjoy the sound and the pricelove these have done well and still have great sound and quality just as good as good if not better then the hip hop brandssony mdr series headphones been always one of the best no wonder many professional studios are using it
i use mine to play guitar at late and dont bother the neighbors
once in a while the ear pad has to be replaced bdfxocan excellent product the audio quality is commensurate with the cost
its design is perfect and comfortable
ive used products like this headset pro and for less money obtiee very similar performanceexcellent i recommend iti bought these on sale and after seeing the reviews
i dont do a whole much with these headphones but plug them into my iphone to listen to podcasts and the weird music i have collected
its hard to describe but these headphones are comfortable and they dont seem to get in the way at all aurallyheadphones are so personal that i cant say these will be the best for you
theyre not perfect for me the cord pulls my iphone off the table for example
but theyre nice enough that theyre what i use every daygreat buy
i read previous recommendations and made up my mind to get this great headphones
they are as described
sounds crispy and i think it gets better as you use them
very good isolation despite you can hear when somebody talks which is a good thing
frequency response is amazing and seem to be well built too
excelent ratio qualitypricethese vs sound amazing
especially for the price
i purchased them used from amazon warehouse and i cant tell them from a brand new pair
i compared the sound quality against a set of  bose qc s that i have for my many business trips and the sonys sound significantly better
of course they are not noise cancelling so i will still use the qc for trips
but for listening around the house or at the office hands down i would use the vsi  have owned many pairs of head phones over the years and listened to many more
these offer simply the best sound experience that i have had
i have even listened with more costly sony headphones and found them lacking in comparison to these
i have been able to rediscover some of my music with these wonderful head phonesthey are so good that many members of my family have also recently bought them
if you love to really hear your music do yourself a favor and buy a pair of these but make sure you read the warnings  they can cause damage to credit card magnetic strips and mechanical devices with small springs eg
watchesthe venerable v is a steal at 
i also own a pair of  mdrs and the sound is indistinguishable between them
hooked up to home or studio gear they sound great
and it is true you can order inexpensive replacement ear pads from sonys parts divisionthe sennheiser hd is the main competitor to the vmdr
connected to studiohome equipment the hd may be a better choice for classical jazz and acoustic music
the mids sound a little cleaner than the v
having said that the hd is larger than the v and requires more power for equal loudness and bass
ipods and mp players just dont have enough juice to power the sennheiser the v is more efficientwow
just wow
ive owned these for a year now and i must say im so glad i bought them
when i bought these i was on a budget of under  and now that i have more funds ive been shopping around for something better but everything ive listened to is simply inferior in one aspect or another
either theyre uncomfortable or dont sound as well but either way i gave up and i have gladly decided to stick with my mdrvs
the attenuation from ambient sounds is incredible especially in a carplane
you can have the volume either as low as it goes or pumped up and these headphones deliver without missing a beat
only pitfall is my head gets a little warm and my hair gets tussled but im ok with itterrific headphones with great balance toptobottom
nice bass lots of detail maybe slightly very slightly rolled off in the treble
this is the shure vmrtypev of headphones
a big plus  very efficient so can be used with lower output devices think ipods and cd players with builtin headphone jacks
ive compared the sonys to the gradosri and i think its close but they dont sound alikebut then theres the comfort issue  you wear the sonys long enough and your ears are going to get sweaty otherwise i find the sonys very comfortable
if you dont like the ear pads bh apparently offers velour ear pad replacements from pearlstone that might help
btw i own two of these headphones  one from  years ago and a recent pair
they sound identicali use these every day at work
comfortable
great sound
much better build and sound quality than any other pair ive owned
tried to talk the kid into these instead of the silly beats but couldnt do it
sound quality is a distant second to looks apparentlycould only be better by allowing for easy cord removal
i almost never need a m coiled cord
ill probably follow one of the excellent diy cord replacements onlineit says a lot about a product these days when its been on the market for more than  years
with todays  year product cycle old technology becomes outdated and obsolete fast forcing many once revered products into retirement
this is extremely impressive when you consider the company that makes these headphones is sony a huge multinational corporation that rarely has any one product out for more than  years
so why have they stuck around for so long
simple because theyre amazing
no set of headphones in this price class and several above can hope to come close to how balanced these things are
all frequencies are represented accurately just as they were recorded and without any coloration
bass lines arent bloated messs like in many modern headphones mid range frequencies are as they should be in existence and treble is highly detailed without scraping at your ears
though not as detailed as a set of  headphones these are not anywhere close to that
hovering around  most days these cans provide incredible value
dont take this the wrong way theyre not amazing for what they are theyre amazing period
buy these for editing sound stage monitoring or neutral listening and you wont be disappointed
though if you buy these because you want street cred and bass that makes your heart beat backwards you clearly didnt understand a word i saidsony mdrv headphones are by far the best headphones out there for the money
i listened to audio technica and drdres beats headphones and in my opinion the sony cans sound the best
the dynamic range is great
good bass clarity at the same time
i use mine with cmoy headphone amplifier and it shines truly with it
i am using it from last  yrs and i enjoyed it all these years
i am happy to see sony still makes them
i will definitely order one more headphones for my family membersprosexcellent sound stage great highs and lows
amazingvery comfortable headphonesexcellent build quality very sturdy using excellent materialsheadphone coil is protected by metal shieldspring type wire  very usefulfrequency range of headphones is comparable or better than much high end expensive headphonesno distortions no loose connection problems no rust after using for  yrs replaced ear pads  timesin  yrslove the matte black finish on the headphonesconsnone noticedi use these headphones several times a week on my computer to listen to music
fantastic sound quality
one of the best audio purchases ive ever made and i have three surround systems in my home
very pleased indeed
would buy again i was curious how this headphones did in comparison with  and they sound exactly identical i did plug both on a  splitter adapter so i can hear both with same song and same equalization they do sound exactly the same so now i dont thing the burning in process really exist my  have easy   hrs of use and and i cant hear any difference so if you cant decide which ones to by between these  just go for the cheaper ones they also look the same but for some reason they feel cheaper  than  thanksafter doing a lot of research and trying all headphones i could get my ears on this choice was exactly what i was looking for
i found most popular brands just had too much bass
the mdrv headphones rely on the true sounds that were actually recorded or meant to be reproduced
i do have to wear hearing aids so hearing with these headphones is such a pleasure while listening to music
i also really enjoy the comfort because i plug them into my stereo system for late nite tv
needless to say iam  very pleased with the sony mdrv headphones
the bass and tones are excellent for me
from s and up rock to country and a little jazz these things are powerful but dont overpower the music
i waited a few days before doing a review i have thrown every thing i have at these headphones and am very pleased
i recommend them to you
they were very well packaged and in a funky display box pretty cool
happy customer thanks amazonthank you sony
this is a very good headphone
comfortable on the ears and not so heavy to bring aroundi purchased these to replace an old pair of vs that had served me well for nearly a decade and the quality of sound out of these is as close to perfection as ive ever heard
it has crisp clear highs and the bass is unbelievable
im hearing bass notes that ive never heard before in a pair of headphones and whats amazing is that the bass doesnt overwhelm or muddy the rest of the sound
i tested on my laptop and my ipod and set the eq to flat on both and the sound is near perfectly balanced no muddy bass weak midtones or tinny highs just beautiful sound that makes listening to music almost a new experiencethe phones themselves seem very well constructed and the cups fit comfortably over the ear
the padding on the cups is thinner than on past models which make the phones slightly more sleek on the head but theyre every bit as comfortable as the older vs that i replaced
the headphone cord extends down from the left ear cup and is coiled and plenty long enough to attach to your laptop or personal music player
it comes with a mm to  adapter so that you can plug it into fullsize headphone jacks on stereos
if youre going to use it on a home stereo id recommend getting a  extension cord for it unless of course you can sit close to your receiverthese are an incredible deal in my opinion
i cant imagine much better sound at any pricei have used the mdrv since  when i was just a kid
i have loved using them everyday since the day i first heard a cd play on them
the sound is like liquid sxx in my ear canal
i seriously had to spend some quality time with the lights out and my cd player and these hps
i still have my original hps and they sound just like the virgin hps i unwrapped the day i first heard digital music
i use the mdr on my digi  for pro tools sessions but they sound exactly like these imo
im emotionally attached to these hps though
the mdr is whats in the studio for anyone
i keep these mdrv for me
i bought these in a special gold edition wrapped in red satin pillow with a special screw on  adapter
i lost the adapter and the satin pillow hit the file  i bought another  adapter from a local store for my midi keyboard
i like the ability for these hps to be worn with one ear folded up so you can listen to yourself sing and listen to your audio at the same time
edit dec  sony dot com is selling these today and they have better response than  hp  its v k and  ksweetwater dot com sells the beyerdynamic dt earpads that are better than the sony ones after a few years
the sony earpads will flake after a year or so
the beyer ones fit the sony v and cant go wrong with these headphones the price is right and the sound is very good
im no audiophile and these arent audiophile priced headphones but they work great for gaming and music sounds crisp and clear
i would say give these a try if you are looking for reasonably priced headphones that sound goodbuy them
light comfortable and great sound
i will say that i was disappointed at first
initially they are too painfully bright but after about  hours i was really impressedthese headphones are fantastic
not only do they produce incredibly full and clear sound but theyre also lightweight and extremely comfortable
they fit firmly on your head cancelling outside noice marvelously without giving the feel that your trapped in a vicemy dad bought a pair of the koss proaa titaniums and i have to say that this sony pair blows those away
while the sound quality is similarly great the kosss are about x as heavy
they really put a dent in your head and start to hurt your ears if you wear them for much more than an hour
the sonys are much more comfortable and much more lightweight and portable
i definetely recommend these
you wont be disappointedthese sounded great and felt really good for extended wearing
it provides awesome sound isolation
the bass improved after the headphones were broken in after a few days
the v provides a natural sound unlike alot of phones that are bass heavy
the thing i did not like was the fact that the hinge that connected the headband to the ear cup is made of plastic and the small wiring leading out of the headband for each ear cup seems like it could get snagged and torn
other than than these sound great
the downside is that the hinge is plastic
i hope they will not snap after prolong usebought these to replace a pair of bose headphones that broke apart after  years
i didnt want to spend a ton of cash on a higher end so after reading reviews i settled on these
i have to say these are better than the  bose headphones i bought
everything is clear and crisp
bass isnt too overwhelming
i mostly use these to listen to my ipod but its almost got me wanting to set up a home studio and get started on some recording to really test them out
only drawback is the exposed wires
im afraid that if i adjust these it might pinch
i will just have to be carefuli cant say enough nice things about these headphones
you will not be disappointed
ive had a pair for nearly  years and they are still killing it
buy a pair now or spend three times as much for essentially the same headphonei bought these headphones to replace my sony mdrv headphones which are the cheapest pieces of plastic garbage ive ever seen
the vs produce a beautiful sound and allowed me to hear details in my music i never knew existed
ive got a denonbose audio setup worth about  and these headphones sound betterthese headphones are ridiculous
theyre worth about  by my standards
it also appears they are built to last as most of the parts are robust plastic or metal instead sonys normal cheap shupdate the little wires that run to the speakers are unable to withstand an encounter with a housecat
i strongly recommend not leaving these headphones along with your carniverous petsi was looking for some beats by dre headphones but i did not have enough money to cash out  for some
i ended up buying the mdrvs for about 
they are worth every single penny and i think they sound better than the beatsi like to listen a lot of rock alternative hiphop and electronic
john mayer justin nozuka santana sound so good through these headphones
if you like listening to mainstream hiphop the bass in these headphones will go down low without distortion
listening to daft punk and justice through these headphones made me love them even moreif you love listening to an array of music genres your ears definitely be satisfied for a lifetime with these headphonesi also use these headphones as studio monitors when i record my own musici have owned two pairs of these since   they were around  in  dollars and well worth the cost then
they lasted about  years before abuse finally cracked them
i went without nice headphones for several years i am very happy that they still sell this model they are compact have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame
they are by far the best value in headphones kudos for sony for keeping production runningi did not know that sony made headphones of this quality and give this pair highest possible recommendationwhenever you see words like professional quality or pro   or studio monitors in the product description run in the other direction
 of the time this is simply exaggeration by an ad copyist who has never been in a recording studio
the v is a happy exception and certainly worth the price of admissionmonitorsa genuine one must allow you to hear every last detail of the soundvoicemusicthe sound of the reverb of the radio studiowhether or not the announcer is using a pop andor wind filterhow far from the mike the announcers mouth iswhat brand of mike is being used for music neumann u or akg have a distinctive soundmike placement in relation to a large chorus andor symphony orchestraacousticsreverbtime of the performance venuebe able to hear individual tracks in a multitrack overdubyes yesthere are not many headphones that meet these requirements but the v certainly qualifies with flying colors regardless of the cost
my old standard akg k electrostaticdynamic has long since given up the ghost but these are a more than adequate substitution besides the k was a wee bit bright but the v is much more flatthis is both good and bad really good recordings will sound even better but bad recordings will sound even worseergonomicsthe plug is solid aluminum rather than black plastic but is straight rather than bentthe cord is long and half of it is coiled so you get plenty of running room but is no good for onthego usesdespite the conventional design it is one of the lightest and most comfortable i have ever used
many hours of nonstop usage is not unreasonable for this pairthe pads are large and surround your entire ear but are certainly not isolating
they are rather soft and the material will wear out with time so expect to replace them at some point and the replacement pads aint cheapjust like the title of my review says ive had these since  and havent had a single issue with them
sony knew they hit the ball out the park with this model and have kept them in stock
what you get is a high quality set of head phones with a very durable coiled cord and a very convenient bag that has come with me to trips around europe and back
while theyre not the best for noise canceling for when flying not really intended to they do make up with great sound a punchy bass balanced mids and highs and all without the need for an amp but dont get me wrong using an amp is also a great option
the specs areimpedance   ohmsdriver unit  mmsensitivity db  dbmwfrequency response  hz  hzhope this helpsbought for my nephew as i have a pair that was purchased in  and after replacing the pads are still wonderfulhe really likes them and i rarely see him without them now
hes hes using them with his iphone ipad and notebookhopefully hell get  years out of themi purchased these after looking into the difference between these and the sony mdr  there is none except these do not have the gold plated jacks
they sound great
i have many other sets of headphones and these are by far the best
i thought the others where great until i heard stuff through the vs
you will hear things in your music you never heard before
they block out noise and are very comfortable on my big head yet they fold down for easy traveli have owned these headphones for somewhere between  and  years and they sound as good today as the day i bought them
i have not treated them the best
i toss them in the drawer i toss them in a basket
sometimes i fold them up and sometimes i dont
i dont know what some other reviewers have done to their headphones but mine have been rode hard and put away wet and still look and sound terrific
they sound great cranked way up or very soft
i use them for my ipod my stereo my computer and my tv
the only thing that has gone wrong is the coiled cord has stretched over time and is a bit awkward to deal with
i can live with it
i have owned some bose triports and have listened to many others while browsing around audio stores and these mdr vs sound as good or better than anything else i have tried
i recently gave my son the boses and i kept the sony mdr vs
they are made with quality materials fit well dont get hot or heavy and sound excellent
the bass is accurate full but not overdone
the mids and highs are crisp and balanced
by the way in comparison to others in the market today they are cheap
im guessing mine will last several more years but just in case im going to snatch up another bargain set and stash them away for the day the music dies
i have enjoyed these headphones every time i put them on and in my opinion you cant go wrong with the sony mdr vpurchased this set for my father who has difficulty hearing
he likes to listen to music on an mp player while mowing the lawn
these work well he says that they sound great and block out a lot of background noise
he is very please with themi used to make music at home and have used various models of headphones at night for quiet mixing
ive also used some for gaming and movie watchingthe mdrv are the best ive used so far
im not claiming to be a pro
these might be mediocre overall if i were able to compare them other cans in the headphone worldall i know is that these sound healthy
i can hear a deep level of bass
it doesnt rumble your ears but you can hear very low frequencies
for example if i pop on some dj magic mike that miami bass music crud i can hear all the low end sounds for the most part
deep rich sound overallthese days i mostly use these for late night movie watching while my son is asleep
they do the job very well for memy only miniscule complaint is the fatigue on my outer ear from the cans pushing in against them
i can get a couple hours in before it becomes irritating sometimes  hours or more if i have them placed perfectly over my ears
this is normal though and all headphones do thisaudio is crisp and clear and design is very comfortable
even more comfortable when paired with the beyerdynamic edt  velour padded earcushionsfor the price you cant beat these
im an audio nut
these headphones are balanced
very versatile
great quality and comfortable fit
cant see a headphone beating these out for the price
they sound like  headphonesive owned two pair of these headphones over the years
this pair was a gift for my grandson
there was a problem with them when i received them
the insulation on the cable was pulling away at the earphones
i returned them and amazon immediately replaced them
if i ever need another pair this is what ill buy againmost comfortable headphones ive worn in a long time  night and day from my previous setsure the sound quality is awesome that much i expected but the comfort amazing
i can see myself wearing these for hours without a thoughtanyone else who says these are uncomfortable either has a really large head and doesnt know it or simply isnt telling us
these have room to spare on my head and my head isnt small im  lbseither way these are awesome
definitely would recommend these to anyonei first got a hold of my first pair of sony mdr v monitor series headphones in the late s
oddly enough it cost about the same back then as it does today
the sound was phenomenal
you actually had to lift the headphone to make sure the bass was not coming from the room
not that the base was unusually loud it was just that is sounded so real
these were studio quality headphones that were actually used in studios
you would see these sony headphones in practically every music video that was shot in a studiofast forward about  years the headphone craze starts up
every audio company want to break into the headphone market
sony adds newer models of headphone that still cant live up to the mdr vs  i decided that i wanted to replace the sony mdr v headphones that had gotten lost long ago
used mdr v headphones were selling for over  if you could find them at all
so i did a little research and found out that although there was a demand for these headsets sony had discontinued the mdr v line anyway
luckily the reason that i could not find the vs was the when the headphones were first reissued they sold out immediately
although i had to wait months i finally got my replacement sony mdr vsso what did i get for all this waiting
i received a true studio tested headset that has a sound so clear that you wonder whether its actually coming from your headset
unlike some other headphones the vs did not artificially increase the treble or base
these sonys were designed to be studio reference headphones which required them to have a flat unmodified sound
in my opinion these headphones are classics that arguably outperform newer and more expensive headphonesi bought these as a gift because i had bought these very same headphones for myself years ago
i love themmaybe nit senhiesers but they are very good phone for the 
this is the second pair i have owned in  years
the first were destroyed by a new puppy in the house
not dog proofbeautiful sound
very clear highs and solid bass
i also have sony noisecancelling phones
i love sony products
very dependable qualityi produce digitally composed music
these are an absolute for anyone that makes computer music just go ahead and add these quality comfortable crisp sounding headphones to your studiono need to look around at other brands or cheapermore expensive ones these are the headphones you are looking for
trust mecheck out my old tunes at  
bunch of new songs droppin in january
my soundcloud will improve now that i have these headphonesof course any audio situation is a matter of personal tastebuti suggest anyone try these who wants to hear what headphones can bethey have the best bassthe purest highs and they are comfortable for listening over a long period
be aware that these will go very loudfar more than mostso be wary when you listen a loti have had a pair for around  yearsand i have replaced the ear padsand they have worked fine always
i paid  when i bought themaround  in todays dollars
this price is exceptional
i was going to buy another pairbut saw no need
professionals use them
i have had many other good onesbutthese are in a class by themselves
you will not be disappointedanother good choice is the sennheiser hdmy second favorite pair and a bargainand i hope all of you realize that ear budsare just wronguseful only in unusual circumstancesdidnt buy these on amazon but had to come and pay my respects
i noticed after buying these that a lot of radio programs would use these headphonesthese really cant be beat by anything else in this price range
theyre quite comfortable thinking about replacing the vinyl ear cushions with velour ones as the vinyl ones make my ears a bit sweaty after extended use
i wont go into audio quality as there are plenty of reviews that do that
the build quality is superb
the coiled cable is sturdy and the plug weighs almost as much as my cell phone
the included adapter screws on very securely
i ordered a few headphones when i was deciding on a pair and these beat out the xb as well as comparable sennheiser and sure headphonesi have a collection of headphones but now by far this is my favorite very comfortable in long use
highly recommended
on the go they are lightly and when not in use they fit in the pocket of my regular jacket
i love them the sound is crystal clear
and for that price nobody can beat themfirst of all im not a musiciandirector or studio engineer just a really big music and entertainment fan and have tried several headphones and actually owned about  headphones in the same price range as the vand a lot of much cheaper ones in the past  and while the ones i liked  were great in their own right the sony mdr vs are the best sounding headphones ive ever listened to
the sound is very even and natural yet extremely detailed and not at all lifeless or boring to listen to
they have a really deep smoothrich yet accurate bass sound and have crystal clear treble and mid rangeoverall there may be other headphones that cost twice as much that sound better but for the price when it comes to sound the sony mdr vs sound absolutely flawless for the money and they are a true bargain
these headphones are not only beautiful to listen to and come beautifully packaged they are also very comfortable and durable
i have had these headphones for  years and havent even had to replace the ear pads yet and i can listen to these headphones for hours without taking a break
the vs are very similar to the s in sound and appearance but i think the vs are actually clearer and even more detailed to my earsit can debated by people that they sound the same but to my ears i can honestly say the vs sound better to my ears and they have an even longer cord than the s so buying a headphone extension cord is not necessaryoverall i would definitely recommend the v to anyone looking for a great soundingdurableaccurate and affordable set of headphonesi purchased my sony mdrv headphones in my very early teens if not earlier after reading a review in stereo review i believe
since then theyve gotten tons of use and ive seen them everywhere
ive gone through  or  cords over the years and theyre finally falling apart
i wanted another pair but settled ha
on mdrvs which are very muddy  all mids
theyre going back today to best buy and im getting a new set of vs from here  i cant believe sony has kept this model alive so long
these are incredible phones
trust mefor alternatives get the followinghttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbajifeieutfcampcreativecreativeasinbajifelinkcodeshrtagswiclulinkidirbsuarerwqdfairly comparable of its rangelove them sound fantastic easy to ware
im a programmer and i ware them for about  hours a day every workday while listing to musicjamesi had these headphones for about  years and i have to say the sound quality is excellent
the fact that they are still looking good means they are well made
if you have a chance to buy them then dont hesitate because you will not get a similar value for the price anywhere
about two years ago i ordered the replacement pads from sony and just installed them yesterday and now the headphones look like new
as for the fit they are comfortable but tight and after a number of hours i can see why some people complain about sore ears
there is a slight difference in the older headphones according to the specs because the older ones used a samarian cobalt magnet and these dont so maybe the cobalt was not as easy to obtain any more
now they are almost the same as the mdr but with a better audio range so why pay double the price
now my only decision is whether to buy another pair when i have a fine working onei first bought these to go with a discman many years ago
i review lots of classical music cds here at amazon and if i listened to them all via loudspeakers it would probably drive my wife nuts
so i often use these headphones instead
another reason i do that is that i find that the sound they deliver is a clear analog of the sound i get from high quality loudspeakers
i find i can wear them comfortably for as long as im listening  and sometimes thats hours at a time  and never have the urge as i do with other headphones to take them off because of physical or aural discomfortmore recently i got an ipod  my kids went together for my birthday and bought me the fanciest ipod available
 and i find that these headphones are much more comfortable and acoustically accurate than those darn earbuds that come with the ipod
i do notice that these headphones apparently have greater impedance than the earbuds that is the volume control has to be turned up a bit to get the same volume as delivered by the earbud
but the improvement in auditory accuracy and comfort is more than worth itthumbs up on this triedandtrue classic set of headphonesscott morrisonive had these headphones on at a reasonable volume and i cannot hear people directly in front of me talking to me
the sound quality is excellent
i want an extra pair because my husband keeps stealing minei have bought many headphones and found that these sound more professional than my most expensive headphones
these cans are legendary in the audio world
with a flat frequency response they are very eq friendly
these headphones will definitely tell you the quality of your music so it is best to have your mps with the highest bitrate possible or use flac whenever you can
i have read that some people are disappointed with the sound it is not the headphones
it is your music source and the equipment used
it is best that you have some kind of headphone amplifier or good audio gear to drive them as ipods and the like do not have the power to properly push themthese are my go to headphones when i want to have a good listening experienceas a last note sony has quietly retired the mdrvs after nearly  years of service
i ordered an extra pair just in case and i also have the mdr as well but prefer the old tried and true mdrvget them while you can and beware of knockoffsthese headphones are great when buying these headphones dont expect major hardcore bass because that is not what they are meant for they are evened out and have a very clear pleasant sound balancing all of the sounds in music videos etcim very happy with this headphones however i cant take them to my office
i just enjoy them in my bed and feel in a concert
great seller beautiful sony packagei have owned sonys mdrv headphones for years the sound quality was okay but they always hurt my ears and werent at all comfortable
then the ear pads stared to deteriorate and leave black specks on my ears and face
instead of spending too much money for replacement pads i decided it was time to buy a new set of headphones
after doing some research and reading reviews i bought my first set of mdrv monitor series headphones
im happy that i did
the sound is better than my old ones and they are very comfortable on my ears
also the price was reasonable
from the reviews i realize not everybody agrees on quality and comfort
all i can do is express my own experience
im very satisfied with these and recommend them
i understand that these pads will deteriorate also
youd think that sony could make pads that wont fall apart after a few years useupdatethese ear pads are starting to deteriorate and get loose also
sony please improve your quality control and make ear pads that last
i can buy replacements but i shouldnt have to
i never did find replacement pads anywhere for the mdrv headphones that werent more expensive than buying new headphones
ranti bought my first pair of mdrv headphones back in   the vs were awesome then and are still awesome today
sony came out with the mdrv phones later and when i wore out my original mdrv phones i tried those out
what a waste of money
the mdrv units are much clearer have lots punchier bass and just sound in your face
the vs sound muffled and weak in comparison
im glad sony listened to their customers and reissued the vs after they were discontinued
they also sell the identical headphones under a professional model number mdr
youll pay about  more for the s and they do have a longer warranty  years as opposed to  and fancy goldcolored jacks but my original vs lasted about  years before needing to be replaced and who cares what color the jacks are
i highly recommend these phones to anyone who needs accurate tight clear sounding phones
if you want the longer warranty and silly gold colored jacks buy the costlier mdr professional ones
either way youll enjoy awesome soundprosclear highs punchy basshigh sensitivity   db at mwcomes with a soft drawstring carrying casecomes with a  to  screwon trs plug adapterconscan be a little uncomfortable over extended periods of use over an hour for me but you can find replacement pads for the earpads that afford a little more comfort
search amazon for sony 
should be around  or sofit perfectly on my head  im  so some headphones are rather loose because the headband is too biggreat noise cancelation without giving me a headachegreat clear soundpossibly the best headphone i have ever bought
the build quality is great one complain the ear cushion can ware off easily but i third party replacements are availableive owned every kind of onthehead audio device from koss electrostatics to elcheapo convenience store earbuds and i have finally found the perfect mix of style comfort value and sonic accuracy
it is difficult to believe unless youve used these sonys yourself that any headphones can look so cool be so comfortable cost so little relatively and sound so good
i listen to jazz rock reggae classical show tunes  pretty much anything and no musical genre is shortchanged
while high and middle notes are reproduced with exceptional quality and accuracy it is absolutely amazing how well bass notes are rendered
listening to the double low c at the beginning of also sprach zarathustra is an experience not to be missed and is especially remarkable because of the absolute lack of the doubling usually encountered with small diameter relatively acoustic transducers
breathtaking
buy em  youll be glad you didupdate  december  love these headphones and it looks like i always will but i have found a way to make them even better
here is a review i wrote on improving the sony mdrv headphonesi bought these ear cushionsbeyerdynamic edt  velour padded earcushions for dt dt sony mdr and v headphones pairfor my sony mdrv phones and could not be happier
the sony cushions are certainly good in fact are a cut well above average but the beyerdynamics are still a clear step above even them
wearing the sonys with the original cushions for more than an hour left my ears a bit sore especially at the very top and bottom where they were slightly pinched
the beyerdynamics however allow me to wear the mdrs indefinitely with zero discomfort
i dont know if its the slightly larger size of these cushions or the material theyre made from but its like wearing air  you simply dont notice their physical presence
and there is an additional benefit for whatever reason probably because of the superior seal these cushions make against your head bass frequencies are enhanced over the already excellent bass produced by the sonys
in fact to make the expression of bass consistent with mid and high frequencies i found using an equalizer helpful
the lowered requirement for the headphone amp to produce bass frequencies allows it to reserve energy it can then use to support a wider and more accurate dynamic range
a winwin situation all because of better ear cushionsin an earlier review i read about how to install the beyerdynamic ear cushions
nevertheless i approached the job with more than a little trepidation worried that id end up with a pretty but nonfunctioning pile of junk
not to worry though a good tug removed the originals and installing the new was a pretty obvious procedure
glad i did it
and yes at least for the sony headphones toss the plastic flanges that come in the package
they might be needed for some other headphone model but not the sony mdrvsnot only are these headphones great to listen tothey fit nice and snug
great sounding phones like these are hard to find at a good price
they are very comfortable and they filter out noise around you
the sound is clear and accurate
i heard sound from my music i never heard beforethats why i give the sony mdrv a best buy  star ratingi bought mine in  without trying them on they just looked nice back then
well they are still going strong
i had to replace the ear pads but that was the best thing i could have done since i replaced them with the velour pads
they are so comfortable
these are also awesome for plane trips because they seem to block out most of the noise
i dont really know if that was the case with the stock pads
i hope the new ones are still as good as the old onesin reading the reviews here i noticed there were a few reviewers that  said these headphones were too tight around their heads
this left me concerned about whether or not i should buy these or continue looking
after all they didnt include any head measurements that i could use to compare my own head withon the other hand most reviewers said the sound quality was excellent
so i went ahead and ordered a pairi received them today and im happy to report these headphones are very comfortable on my head
my head measurement    inches which is  centimeters  the headphones stay firmly on my head even when i turn my head
i dont hear any type of distortion when i turn my head
i wear glasses and the headphones are still comfortable on my earswithout any stretching the cord is long enough to go down to the floor and then around to the back of my pc which sits on the floor below my desk
the cord will stretch out longer
the cord doesnt pull on the headphones or provide any type of discomfortthe sound quality is excellent as stated by the other reviewers
in fact i have the volume turned almost all the way down on itunes and i can still hear the music very clearlyi would recommend these headphonesi love these headphones
it gives me a nice clear crisp sound when listening to music and videos
my boyfriend didnt know what the difference was between good headphones and quality headphones until i let him borrow these
now he wont give them back to me  i always go with samsung and lg for anything visual and sony for all things audiothis was my first headphone years ago
a sony seller frind of my fayher gifted it to me
it was already old but i loved it
all of you can notice
this is the headphone with less  star in amazon
only  yes ihave had sennheiser
they are less confygood and badsits really neutral
sound is great and i know from experience that the speakers will last years
the cord is strong
its comfortable
i could sleep wih them oni connected it to my component and damn
my ears vibratedif  taken care of they will las years
can be modded and repairedi use them with my phone
best headphone dor the price
this is a neutral headphone
it reproduces things just like they were recorded
if you want trebles or lots of basd you will have to do it  with the equalizer
its great since i listen to all kinds of musici tried these out before burning them in and a hour burn in was enough for me to notice a difference in the overall responsiveness
i use these to doublecheck my mixes and to help balance out my recordings in addition to regular studio monitors
they also work well in a slightly noisy environment when you need to monitor somethingthis is simply put the best headphone that ive ever own
ive never heard anything that sound remotely as good as this headphone
im hearing subtle sounds and beat from my music that i never heard before
and the price couldnt be better and the cool packaging was a nice topping
my only regret is not knowing about this class of headphone sooneri have a small recording studio and bought these for mixing phones after reading some reviews
these have a great clear sound not too bottom heavy like some headphones can bethey can hurt alittle after you wear them for awhile but over all these are really great headphones for everything from mixing to just listening to your favorite tuneshaving never owned or even listened to a pair of highquality headphones i was astonished by the clarity and detail afforded by this model
it demonstrates the inadequacy of the several players i have  the best sound source seems to be had by playing cds on a dvd player through a widescreen lcd television
they also allowed me to hear previously inaudible features of heretofore familiar recordings
the players breathing and scuffling in the quiet passages of a string quartet were clearly discernable as they would be if the players were giving a private concert in my living roomi bought these primarily based on the reviews on amazon  so this one is only adding to the existing positive chorus
the sole design flaw seems to be the headband that only touches the head at one point
they seem to be comfortable anyway and to be fair this is a traditional headphone design
the split headband with soft fabric surmounting the head and a separate spring above exemplified by the bang and olufsen form  the rca whr  and others may be more comfortable over long periods
however recently in a local record store i noticed that the headphones provided for customers to sample the records before purchase were this very modelafter having my mdrv headphones for six months i think i can finally give a review of thempro  flat accurate sound from low to high that gets smoother the more i use themreasonably light weight for their sizegenerally well built except for the exposed wire leading to each earpiecethe low impedence allows me to use the v with my retro portable cd players one of them only uses  aa battery with good sound volume
no need at all for an amplifiercon  when putting the headphones on my fingers sometimes get caught in the exposed wires leading to each can
ive learned that when one of my fingers cant let go of the headphones after putting them on to stop and gently pull whichever finger is caught out of the wire loop lest i rip the wire out of the canthe pleather earpads that come with the vs tended to make my ears really hot and sweaty in summer weather
i replaced them with a pair of beyerdynamic velour padded earcushions for the dt from bh photo
big improvement in comfort and sound quality especially comfort
the beyerdynamic pads are cooler and more transparent to sound than the pleather pads that come with the vs
i should have ordered the beyerdynamic pads at the same time i ordered the v phones and replaced the original pads immediately
when i get my backup mdrv im going to do just thatsummary  if your taste in sound tends towards flat uncolored accuracy as does mine and you dont want to spend loads of  then the mdrv is the one
bassheads probably should look elsewherethe empirical  evidence published at headroom com which is now hard to find  showed these phones to be among the very best ever produced
their start  in the s began when they were picked as best buy in consumer reports
they were also the best of the many tested as having the best sound at any priceat that time
they remain so  despite a few reviews even by audiophiles who are reviewing their own hearing or are playing to their client audience with advertising bias they remain today among the  ten headphones at any price
my first pair lasted  years 
i bought a new pair surely they had deteriorated in sound to place back in my headphone stable this includes akg  and beyerdynamic dt at present
the sonys did not deteriorate in sound quality
only the inexpensive ear pads are a nuisance as they are on every brand that uses pleather small potatoessome confuse the clean extremely low bass with exaggerated bass
i call it subwoofer bass in a headphone
you will not be disappointed or need to look any further folks one of the true bargains in hi fi historyi wear my sony mdr v headphones at work in an office
usually they get about  hours of use a day
i must include the fact that i wear eye glasses
i am totally satisfied with these
they sound great and the comfort level is  even with glasses
my head is a size   around and my ears are about normal size
recommendedi am very happy with these headphones
for under  bucks you get sound quality equal to the bargain sets around twice the pricemy primary purpose when purchasing this headphone is to drown out loud background noise
secondary is music listening i am not a music buff
wear it for about   hours each time and it is still comfortable when i take it off
i work in a very loud place computer data center room and this device drowns out the noise really well
i will leave the how well the sound is delivered  out of my review as there are numerous other reviews that can convey that message much betteri had this phone for more than  years now
the pads started to fall apart about  years ago but the sound is still good as new
in the past  years i spent lots money on many mp players dvd players and many of them are broken or outdated now but i kept using this phone so it was money well spent because it was used on daily base
i tried other phones which did not cost lots of money but were very good quality products like koss sportapro unlike the most mdrv is a closed type phone which helps to block noise like running ac in a office
i compared it to a senheiser hd i liked  the sound of mdrv more
in my opinion mdrv phone has a deeper yet clean bass hd blocks noise better but i prefer a better bassi did not buy these here on amazon due to discount i had with sony but purchase was made due to the high reviews given on this product
let me say that amazon reviewers never steered me wrong and they sure didnt on these either for this price you cant beat the quality of sound these give out
the sound is so clean and natural and like the  you hear sounds in even older music that you never heard before
the  is a great set of headphones itself but i prefer these i think the bass on the v is better and for the price why not get both they still cheaper combined than beats and bose
i was in awe of the studio beats i bought them in december but since sold it due to the bleed coming out where everyone else around you can hear your music
back in december these v was out of stock everywhere and now i know why but since late april and early may they are available everywhere but not cheaper than amazon unless you can get a discount from someone else
contrary on some reviews where they say the build quality or the comfort level is sub par i dont see that at all these are very well built and i dont baby them at all due to the price
i can wear these for hours and times i dont want to take these off due to the great sound im getting from my iphone s or ipod classic
when i listen to my iphone and the tune in radio app it just sounds awesome
i even got a spare pearlstone pads just in case the original wears out or come off but no signs of that yet
i do like the fact that when i pump the volume on these no one else can hear my music it has a great seal on your ears
when i saw that these headphones been around for  plus years i knew these must be great and it didnt disappoint you cannot go wrong buying these just look at all the great reviews and if you look at the bad one you see why others just jump with comments on those guys but beware they are a lot fakes around so buy from sony authorized sellers onlythese headphones sound amazingly good and are even better considering i got them for around  refurbishedthey fit very well in my head and i can use them for hours
they also fold and come with a pretty nice carrying bagwould definitely purchase againi initially bought two cheaper headphonespanasonic rpht  jvc harx believing that i would be wasting money if i bought a more expensive setboy was i wrong
i picked these up in the black friday week of deals for  and could not believe what i was listening too
my music never sounded this good through my mbd integrated audio before
the bass was clean accurate and not overpowering the mids were clear and the highs were crisp without being overly bright
the sound isolation is also pretty goodill admit at times it feels like a clamp on my head and i currently have it pulled down where i can see  notches on either side to fit
the ear cups also might not fit around people with big ears but by no means are these smallthe headphones come with a mm adapter a leatherette carrying pouch and is equipped with a thick coiled cableas good as these headphones are i do not know how they will survive on the go it can be folded into a more portable size but they label them as a studio monitor headphone and they have wires that are exposed around the headbandif i knew they were this good i would have bought more of them and soonerits a decent headphone for the priceamazing soundfor indoor use is perfect but for outdoor like using with ipod not to good the cable is to long and curlywow
just wow
im a  yr old with a crazy obsession with sound and music
audiophile
maybe
these headphones are so perfect in every way
the sound is so crisp clear and clean the design is awesome and simple and the materials are very high quality
they are so comfortable even for my sensitive ears
the bass is just absolutely perfect not choppy or muddy at all
forget the beats forget the souls by ludacris save yourself the money and get higher quality at half the price
theres no surprise that these have been so widely used for almost  years
the included adapter is perfect because it allows me to use these cans in my iphone and home audio system which is also  sony i just love their audio hardwaremy last set mdr v broke at the screwscotch tape made them usable again but finally i had to give inwhen the cups shreddedim not cheapjust thriftythese seem to be strongeras i really abuse themalmost thinking of adding the scotch tape nowto reinforce themthe sound is as about as good as it getsbut how can i knowis there a law of diminishing returns for headphones sound pleasingnesssubjectiveas i go over the latest offerings i can see none that rate higher than theseall at  starsi try to weight the negative reviews  of  stars   of  stars  half the  of  stars total vshalf the  of  and all of  sa model can have a  ratingbut if the bottom  total are significanti stand backi was thinking that since ive had these for 
yearsthat technology must have increased to make a better sounding set of hpsive noticed shocking price drops since i last visited a few months agobut since all i need are new earcups why not spend lt rather than esp in this economyyes i know when my choices are multiplied by the millions we see black friday turn into black xmasmy only question is why these did not have the gold plate plug insi saved the outer larger gold plug in from the broken set but of course the benefit might be lost since the smaller silver plug still must go in firsti really enjoy having bass back in my music
these mdrvs are excellent quality and also work well when used with my ipadafter close to  years i broke down and got my second pair of my mdrs  my first two mdr witch i have are the best headsets you can buy
the mdrv is the same just a bit smaller and lighter  for the price i am absolutely blown away  they should be well over  and i paid more than that two decades ago for my old set
you cant go wrongto begin the sound on these is very detailed and it will play your music like it is
if your music is a poorly recorded track it will sound poorly recorded so i recommend feeding these studio monitor headphones the highest quality sound files you can
the bass can extend deep and low yet remain tight not flabby the mids are well balanced and have no artificial coloration to them and the highs are all there
i auditioned these at a store before i bought them and preferred them to the audio technica ms grado srs sennheiser s and even some amped sennheiser hds
and these sony vs dont need amping at all because can be easily driven by an ipod and get get really loudi dont think these have a perfectly flat response they are a little bass and treble heavy to my ears
i believe everyones ears are different and for me i agree with the reviewers that say the treble can be harsh
and because of this i could not crank the volume without the treble eventually becoming fatiguing
but since i still loved the sound and clarity of these i tried to see if i could change this
i went to the craft store and bought some thin felt for a few cents cut it to proper size and then placed it between the headphone driversspeakersand the ear pads
this cut down the harshness without changing anything else and now i decided i will be keeping theseanother modification i had to do relates to my ears
my ears are big and poke out and these headphones were very uncomfortable because they pushed on my ears to much since they do have some clamping force for sound isolation
i found another simple solution for this you cut some thin strips of cloth from a tshirt and push them in the crevice under the pad that goes around your ears to give more space between your ear and the drivers thus making them rest around your ears up against your head and not on your ears
you dont want to shove too much material in there or you start to lose some bass and could maybe tear the ear pads if you get too crazy
just a half of an inch width by six inches long folded in half hot dog style worked great for me
i found i didnt need to upgrade to the beyerdynamic pads after doing this and now these are comfortable for hours and this saved me twenty four dollars
since the headband has a metal spine through it i was also successful in carefully bending it outward to provide less clamping force on my larger than normal headthe sound isolation on these is great and i actually love the coiled cord which helps from keeping the cord ripped out of the headphone if it gets snagged on something
they are built very well but i do not like the small wires exposed on the sides which i think makes them vulnerable to snag so i will have to be careful
i think these headphones are as good as you can get for  if you want better you are going to have to start spending a lot more money
just make sure you buy from a refutable seller and make sure you dont buy fakes which are out there in abundance
these headphones are great so i wrote this review to let you know there potential and to show you how you can improve them with simple non permanent mods if you are inclined to try them
i hope sony never stops making theseother reviews are good
i like these because they are supposedly flat
i like my games and sound cards to do the adjusting of the sounds
good for music and games
interesting note when my dad did research and picked a pair of these in the s he picked these alsoi know it seems great to have todays portable earbuds
but you cant beat the sound quality for the dollar in sony headphones
i have the old version of these loved them for the past  years
my hubby borrowed them and wouldnt give them back
so i ordered these for him hoping hed switch he did  yay
before you order any of the celebrityendorsed or other logorelated headphones check the hz
for the dollar you wont beat these sweet phonesi have used way more expensive headphones than these and they dont hold a candle to the sound you get with the sony mdrv
these are classics for a reason
my dad had these same headphones back in the s and they are still around competing in the market to this day
i dont know about you but i cant name too many products that stick around for  plus years
tried and true and used in professional recording studios you cant go wrong with these
get emthese are the best headphones in this price range by far
the bass is great listen to a lot of hiphop and house the quiet strings listen to classical and everything in between honestly best for that price last you  or more years if you take care of them of coursesony mdrv monitor series headphones with ccaw voice coili purchased these to listen to my mp collection on my tablet and they sound amazingare comfortable and ooze with quality hey its a sonyi bought my current pair of mdrv phones about  years ago and they still are the best sounding headphones ive heard and they still sound as good as they did back then
to solidify my confidence in them over the years any time ive seen any documentary or video of a rock group that showed any band members or engineers in the studio they were always using the mdrv
if its good enough for the pros its good enough for me
the amazing thing is that the price really hasnt changed much
i think i paid about  or  for mine
anyway i guarantee these headphones will not disappointby the way i noticed that amazon suggests a headphone plug adapter as a paired purchase with these
i dont know why they would do that
unless sony has changed something these come with that
it has the standard home stereo system plug which unscrews to reveal the smaller portable player plug underneath itive read other reviews about amazon pairing items that dont even go together
dont assume you need itexcellent sound quality and faithful reproduction better than anything ive ever listened to
when i first got them i relistened to my whole collection just so i could pick out all the bits id missed out on before
blows away beats and bose and whatever other overpriced brands are out there
at first these were a bit uncomfortable
i replaced the pads with some velour ones that i also bought from amazon
now they are much more comfortable and seem to be better at blocking out sound both ways good for when you want to listen in a quiet room
i think they look good too they arent bulky like some other models
nowadays after breaking them in and the velour pads i will occasionally fall asleep in my bed with them on and i dont mind keeping them from when i wake up to when i go to bed i am a heavy music listener if you cant telli mostly listen to metal and classical but this plays just about anything really well
i do have to mention that these headphones reproduce music perfectly which also means less bass compared to other phones beats that intentionally inflate bass which in my opinion distorts music that doesnt need it
if you have an equalizer on your audio player or computer its no big deal at all
when i listen to hiphop or electronic music sometimes i jack up the bass and these headphones can put out a good thumpi spent a long time researching headphones
i truely appreciate quality sound but im cheap so i didnt want to spend a lot
well for under  these headphones couldnt be any better
absolute clarity with incredible richness and punch
i love these headphonesive owned both and there is no comparison
first off this is a truly great pair of headphones in the  range
they have a very flat frequency response which means the lows mids and highs pretty much get equal billing
this is fine for me
because they were made more for studio monitoring rather than casual listening some might feel they are lacking at the low end but i think they just represent the music more faithfully
if you need to adjust the bass up higher then go for it
they can handle it and much better than the mdrvs which produce boomy low quality bass
the low frequencies on these are much tighter and more defined
middle frequencies on these are great as well
little to no coloring vocals come through great
middle frequencies on the s are pretty awful
its like someone turned the treble up to  i dont know how else to put it
the one criticism i have of these is the poor quality of the earpads
not only do little black flakes of fake leather start to come off after moderate use but they completely came apart at the inner seam on mine exposing the foam inside
i know im not alone in experiencing this and quite frankly its a little baffling why they have not addressed this issue in the  years this model has been available
there are lots of options as far as replacement pads go so despite that i would still highly recommend these on the basis of great sound qualityi bought these to monitor vocals from a sony m and boom mic during amateur filming and to double as a portable set of cans for casual listeningwhen they first arrived i plugged them into my soundcard and listened for about an hour
i was satisfied but not thrilled the way that so many others have been
the vs are legends but i didnt see what all the hype was about
i mean they sounded good for the price but not to the degree i was anticipating
bass is very good treble is very sparkly and bright but the mids are unacceptably recessed and even at times sound hidden or veiled
treble was riddled with sibilance too not good
now at home i typically listen to ads which have incredible midrange
furthermore i understand that the vs get better and better with burnin
we shall see
at this point i was just meh about the vs
then i remembered what i really bought them fori brought up some highbitrate voice recordings that are stored on my pc
wow
these cans have incredible detail
very very analytical
i auditioned almost everything in the lowend pro monitoring segment ie
shure srh ark  at mfs etc
etc
for pure analytical work such as vocal tracking none come close except maybe the shures which are so bass shy that they are almost a nonconsideration
so bottom line is if you are in the sub  segment for the same reasons as me then you want these
if you want just good phones for listening on a bus or in the library id get audio technica mfs or m which are less power hungry more comfy and have a slightly more engaging overall sound
but for a good multipurpose headphone with no compromises in vocal detail and an impulsebuy price point these simply cant be beat and after all these yearsgreat headphonesthey work well with ipod computers stereosbasically everythingamazing soundquite comfortable although sometimes a bit hothighly recommend theseonly downside is that they arent nearly as stylish as many other closed headphones out there and no noise reductionmike toronto ontarioive gone through a lot of different headphones all ive loved for different reason but in the end i decided to stick with these
they dont do anything bad in my opinion
also id recommend you buy the velvet ear pads for themprosgreat sound clear crisp and bass is perfect not over saturated to the point where you cant hear the musiccheap for its qualitybuild is solid and not very plasticy like othersnot tight on the head nor does it fall off from being too looseconsi have encountered noneof course you can spend a ton of money on amps dacs and headphones
this pair of headphones will deliver  of the quality of super high end gear at about  of the costi also own the ath m and id recommend the sony mdrv unless youre into more bass heavy things
the sonys are also more comfortable
they dont feel as sturdy but theyre very well built toounconditional recommendationif you ask my hubby i know he would say this is the best gift i ever gave him
he drives a truck and when he is getting loaded or unloaded he spends alot of time on the docks
these headphones take out a done of the back round noises so he can listed to his mp player or do work on the laptoprumor has it that these sony mdrv headphones are being or have already been discontinued
that is a shame because they are definately the best sounding headphones that i have ever owned and i have owned many
i have always been in the habbit of purchasing highend headphones which are usually heavy very large and typically make your ears uncomfortably hot after extended use
after reading rave reviews for the sony mdrv over the past several years i finally decided to give them a try for myself
after hearing that they were being discontinued i was afraid that i would not be able to find them anymore
i was extremely happy to find them right here on  and for a great pricesome of the primary reasons for my decision to purchase this model include the high sensitivity level dbmw the large mm drivers and the impressive  hz frequency response
the high sensitivity allows these headphones to be used with low powered devices such as my ipod touch
although these headphones sound best when plugged into a home stereo receiver they still sound stunning when plugged into a portable mp player
so if you desire a quality set of headphones which can be used with virtually any audio device you may own the sony vs are the perfect choice
deep bass smooth and natural midrange and crisp yet not piercing clean treble these cans produce the widest frequency range that anyone could expect from headphones costing three times as much
the vs may not be perfect for those wanting bass enhancement
the bass is definately deep with these phones but it is tight rather than boomy and muddy soundingthese headphones are light rated  g  which is about  lb and comfortable to wear for hours at a time
the clean uncolored sound will make you soon prefer to listen to all of your music through these headphones rather than through fullsized speakers
they do a pretty good job of blocking outside noise without entirely preventing you from hearing the phone ring if you have the ringer set loud enough the children calling you or even hearing the doorbell ring
the build quality is very good and i am expecting these phones to last me for many years to come
they even come with a nice pleather case to hold them in when not in use
the phones fold up nicely and fit in the case perfectly
the  ft coiled cord is rugged and well shielded and there is an included adapter to convert the mm miniplug to a fullsized  plug
i would highly recommend the sony mdrv headphones to anyone who is serious about listening to quality audio
but dont wait long to order because i suspect that they will not be on the market much longermy son really loves these headphones
the really cut out external sounds well and sound very full
for the cost it is really hard to find this kind of quality in soundthese are so good i bought another pair
my little bastard cat ate one of the little wires that hang and it broke one of the ears but since sony makes such good stuff i was able to fix it with a little razor and some black tape
i use these to keep my girlfriend from hearing when i write songs about how much i want to kill that catthis review is not for pros just for people like me who want something better than ear buds
i just got these headphones yesterday and i have previously owned the sony mdrvdj and the  sony mdrxd and i can safely say that the sound quality of the v is at least the same and in most cases better than the previous two
i dont know the technicalities of sound performance but these headphones are clear even at a pretty loud volumepros really good build quality metallic hinges and all
a welcome change after the vs
smallest circumaural design out there
pretty quiet
very good sound quality
i heard some lyrics  sound that didnt know existed even though i had been listening to the song for yearscons i read from previous reviews that these can be worn for a long time but i didnt find that to be the case compared to the xds
because of the minimalist circumaural design i wouldnt recommend this for folks with larger than normal ears
high impedance and hence not the best for mp players
i had to bump up the volume of my iaudio by  to be able to listen to lyrics
however i am still only at about a third of the maximum and so its not all that bad
telephone type voice coil and hence heavy
i would have preferred a cordtype oneim reviewing this with no typing skill so my mistakes are present im human
grammatical errors will occur and frankly i do not carethats satire
actually im free response for rolling bone
not lancei own grado is sony mdrv sennheiser  hds  and able planet b series for shortthe grados had me but the construction is junk
dont under estimate this
they sound the best
grados fall apart
the mdrv are number  now
the sonys are built better
they are now the best
the sennheisers are built but lack the sound of the grados or the mdrs
the grados were the best but they need to call stanley tools or someone so they can construct something that lasts
the able planets were out of this world with a battery running
no other headphone needs a battery
these phones are the best next to the bose for noise cancelling and bargainthere is a problem with  of the headphones
the grados are very weakly constructed
i had a whole can fall off
i crazy glued the muff
i mean can
no big dealstronger than ever seriouslymy opinion grado with my most respect should crazy glue the notch you put in to the cans to hold the phone to the set
the sound quality of grados  are out of this world
construction junk
truthi hooked the sonys and the sennheisers to an amp for my music
not your stereo
a guitar amp
they held up
understand these are not made for thisif your buying sony sennheiser or grado and able planet
these all are great phones for your ears
if you want the package
its the so ifso ifso if  you are everyday person looking for the best head phone for your surround sound system
the sony mdrv are for you
they are excellent
if you could get over the cord
buy a straight attachment for theseso if you are the every day person looking for the best headphone in the market dont buy 
the sony mrdv
find something better
then tell me for that price you got better
we  are the poor peers for the great ears headphoneloves the only house
thats cheap for really top of the line music
oh by the way
they are as good as the grado
i mean that
scary goodtell me im wrong pleasebest headphones i ever bought
fits on my head perfect no need to press down on it to feel the bass
works well with trance music
alots of bassi love the sound stage of this headphones i have been using them more and more everyday
besides the shure srh are superior imho for jazz  classical the sonys are amazing for those mixed playlistim coming from a pair ofpanasonic rphtxppa retro style monitor headphones bluethat had their ear pads wornout in only  months the ear pads were  each to replace
no thank youjudging by the other sony mdrv customer reviews and suggestions for better headphones on bose headphone reviews i decided to order a pair
people saying their first pair lasted for  or  years is what i wanted to hear after owning several pairs of headphones that woreout far too quicklyive owned these headphones for almost a month now and couldnt be happierdurability aside the sound quality is great
ive had enough different pairs of headphones and home speakers to be able to judge sound quality
the mdrv arent dramatically better than my old panasonic headphones but they do have noticeably richer overall sound and better bass
i enjoy balanced sound  for my wide taste in music and these headphones are great for anything ive listened to with themhappy customer herebought these headphones  years ago
had to replace the ear pads but they still sound great
i would buy them again if and when i have a need for a new set of headphonesonce upon a time i thought apples earphones were the best
lol
i felt like god when i first used mdrv cans
its like upgrading a game character from level  to  in an instantthese are really good headphones
there is a lot of great reviews on these so im not going to bother going into that
i would be very surprised to hear someone did not like the sound of these
i would highly recommend
ai wont take away from the other reviews that state the sound quality for the price on these headphones cant be matched theyre wonderful sounding headphonesthere is one serious problem though which if overlooked yeah will leave you without themmy first pair lasted around  years or so this latest pair not sure if this is a design changemy sound cuts off on the right phone after only a yearthe problemthe wire that runs outside and alongside the headphones sticks out and if youre not careful will get sandwiched in between the phone and the bracket in time this will wear it and cut the wire i couldnt believe it but sure enough the wire is exposed and is causing the right phone to now cut off  i think i can repair it with tape on mine but this is a design problem for those who like me didnt realize they were cutting the sound wire over time  a short year
just make sure the wire isnt going between the bracket and phone each time you put them on and itll be fineif you love the mdrs you will love the vs
i was hesitant to switch but after many promising years with my s i did not feel alienated with the v headphones
if i had  to spend on headphones i would still get these any day of the week
rich bass excellent vocals and pristine clear sound overall
anyone who works radio podcasts or records music will want thesethere are lots of reviews here and most appear to be ontarget relative to my experience with these headphones
but here are my  centsi got these to replace some aging sony mdrvs that i purchased maybe  years ago
the ear cushions of the mdrvs had begun to deteriorate and i figured it was time to see what had improved in  years
i just compared them to the older vs and i can say that the v is definitely better
they fully surround the ears vs just sat on your ear pressing on them
the vs also seem to offer more detailed sound
i concur that they sound a little bright but i can take care of this on my ipod by setting the eq to reducetreble but i like the brightness so sometimes i dont do that
i do not concur with other review comments about weak bass
they appear to have the right amount
imho  it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade at the expense of flatness and noncoloring of sound
i also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good plenty loud for me with the ipod  and i listen at good levels  albeit not ear damaging onesas a last comment i notice amazon has these for about 
i paid  at a local store
buy from amazon 
no  i dont work for or invest in them the sound is decent and the built quality is great
i certainly think these will last me few years
these however do hurt the first time i wear them but im sure it will become better in the futurethere are three things i really like about these headphonesthe first is that they are light and comfortable
think slippers for your ears
you can almost forget you are wearing them
the second is the total lack of the enclosed sound most headphones have to some degree
this means you can also forget that you are listening through headphones
the third is their startling clarity
you dont have to strain to make out sounds
the overall effect is that the designers of the mdr vs have effectively removed the headphones from the listening experience
this in itself is a phenomenal achievement
you should have these headphones if only to experience this level of performancebut are they sonically perfect
well no not really
the low bass can sometimes sound a bit punchy and thereby be a distraction
the soundstage often does not extend much beyond your head
they are not euphonic headphones  which will mask poor material with a big midbass hump  this is a good thing actually
and they sometimes seem a little thin in the lower midrange so that voices might not sound as rich as you might like
but given the way these phones present the sound they  need make no apologies
they produce a clean uncolored and wide range sound
no wonder people use them for so longi am casual listener and looking for headphone which satisfy my need for music and this is where my search has endedwell i cant praise these headphones enough they sound amazing on the average computer with nothing but a headphone output and they shine like the sun through an amp and equalizer
they even work very well with the ipod touch which can tend to be underpowered for larger diaphragm headphones such as these but once again they didnt fail to perform
the voice coil is perfect for being able to keep things neat while sitting at a desk but still being able to have your headphones on and run over to the shelf or even stretch them to a closeby room not kidding
i just cannot get over the sound quality for such an inexpensive set of headphones
my only gripe is that within the first couple months ive had to have the ear cups replaced by sony free of charge and multiple people seem to have this problem
i bought a pair of beyerdynamic cupsbeyerdynamic velour earcushions mdr headphonesand they seem like they will last
otherwise the metal frame and chamber are impressive and the hefty cord and ends seem like theyll last a good long time
although theyre a little chunkyold fashioned to bring in public for some people i dont have much of a problem with the design
its very comfortable for long periods of wear as welleditthese were purchased april rd of  and the right earcup has stopped working as of september th  they served me quite well indeed for the time ive had them but this is really unacceptable especially considering all of the amazing reviews ive read for how long other customers have had these for
has the quality of construction gone down
ill try to update my review as for the experience of rmaing them or getting them repaired and how much it costsi priced many headphones  and this one was the biggest bang for the buck i cant see how spending more on headphones would make a differencepros  consuncolored sound
some people may find that these headphones feel warm or cause sweatingflat frequency response curve
during prolonged useexcellent frequency response range
not many cons imo
these are the best cleanest sounding headphones that itight clean punchy bass response
have heard in the  or less category
they are monitors and they do notclear crisp but not overwhelming highs
color the sound in any way
they are meant to accurately reproduce thegood clean midrange
source material
enjoy your new sony headphones
lightweight and comfortable even duringextended useholy smoke 
this quality headphones make you listen to all of your music collection again i tried different ones over the years
so far this v by sony sounds the besteverybody has different hearing music taste  also different audio equipment
so the sound quality you prefer to getis a personal preference  not just depend on the specific brand or model of headphone or speaker
its a try  choose gamethe sony mdrv is very comfortable on your head  over your ears nice reproduction of high  low frequencies hzit has excellent deep clean bass i listen to all kinds of good music from alternative to tranceit definitely sound better than my sennheiser hd pro which is heavier still good one though plug it in  hit play  you will fall in love 
lt buy it i cant believe i got by for years without owning these as a music loveri got chills right away the first time i cranked up some favorite tunes with these new old cans
well new to me
the frequency response is supposedly k hz
at this price point youd be hard pressed to find better i should thinkgood seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while
great soundshort and sweet well worth the costthis headphone is especially good for rock less so for classical
it sounds best if driven from a low impedance amplifier
in that case it goes very low and has some slam in the bass
otherwise it lacks the slam and doesnt go as low
rock vocals cut through with authority try the stones for a good experience
 as does electric guitar
i havent tried them with current pop but my wife has and she loves themive recently purchased the sony mdrv headphones after purchasing sonys very similar but not identical  see belowsony mdr professional headphonejust a few months ago
my reason for purchasing a second pair and getting both models was because these vs were very inexpensive at the time i ordered and because i was curious to see if i could tell a difference between the two
in reading many of the reviews here on amazon and elsewhere i knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences if any and which has the superior soundthese are both headphones in the  and below price category which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound
i do not like to listen to music using earbuds i prefer this style of overtheear headphone
although it does take some getting used to
i also have very inexpensivekoss ksc portable stereophone headphonesfor occasions when i dont want to use my more expensive sonysi am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones both models and with the comfort
they are the first quality headphones that i have owned and the level of detail in the sound lack of distortion and overall quality is simply superb
i am completely satisfiednow regarding both similarities and differences between the sony mdr and sony mdrv here is what i have observed externally they are almost identical in construction and appearance
the v has red stickers on each headphone for digital and the  has blue stickers professional
the phono jack for the v is silver metal all metal for the  is gold rubber and gold
those are the only visible differences i am able to detect when i listen to the two headphones back to back at the same volume level and with the same music i can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the  and very slightly clearer sound
this is consistent with several of the other reviewers on amazon for the  who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the  with the vs sounding a bit warmer
one reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different  the  uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels where the v uses a single ground for both channels
it seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway but maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones
however when i went to sonys website to check the specifications for the two models that is not what i found
and here is what the wikipedia page states for these headphones both models share the same part number for their driver but the magnet therein is known to vary
the mdr was introduced with a samariumcobalt magnet as is currently used in the mdrv
however at some point the mdr switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet
these changes were made without changing the driver part number
 the box for the  states neodimium magnet
the operating instructions included with the v state samarium cobalt magnet
possibly either or both of these are out of date as wiki states they may make spec changes over time  the  box is copyright  and the v copyright is  the  box includes an exploded view and parts list which is very nice to have
the v box does not both headphones include a soft case for storingcarrying the headphones and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo miniplug or a normal size plugupdate  and  the sony mdrv and mdr headphones have just recently been reviewed by cnet with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality
both headphones receive a very high recommendation from cnet
see the mdr review at  and the mdrv review at according to the specifications on sonys website which should be uptodate the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response mdr neodymium magnet  mm driver khz frequency response  ohm impedance  dbwm sensitivity mdrv neodymium magnet  mm driver khz frequency response  ohm impedance  dbwm sensitivityi am not able to explain how sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical but this is what they are saying
and the two headphones do have slightly different soundalthough there is a slight difference between the  and v the sound from both headphones is very neutral
the professional choice between the two seems to be the  and it is the more expensive model
if you read other reviews you will find that the s are commonly used by studio engineers because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do
at this point for me they are both excellent and for thirty bucks less id go with the v if i could have only one of the twoive been using these headphones with theaudioengine d bit digitaltoaudio converter and i am extremely pleased with the quality of the soundas a final comment some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort
i also purchased a pair ofbeyerdynamic edt  velour padded earcushionsfor this reason and although i have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the sony headphones i do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort as well as replace them when they have become worn some owners use these headphones for many yearsi notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones many of them longtime owners who feel very strongly that these sony headphones are the best
im just beginning to use them but i have high hopes that they will be durable over time and that i will continue to be as satisfied with them as i am todaycomfortable and sound greatno complaints whatsoever
they feel well made sturdy and durablegreat for turning the music up to  while still being a good neighborwould certainly purchase againi did a lot of researching before purchasing this and i am very pleased
music just sounds better and i was very much surprised
im not an audiophile i am a regular consumer
ive used  earbuds and they dont compare imo to what you can get through headphones
the only negative i can think of is that the padding can get warm if worn for a long time
i bought a replacement earpads non sony and now its perfect
i use to study because it can be noisy outside of my roomi would buy this if youre getting your feet wet and want the best for sub  headphonesi wouldnt buy this if you care what this might do to your hairfirst headphone purchase of over 
did extensive research and landed on these
do not overlook the fatiguing that is mentioned these are definitely high in that category
i find myself keeping them half on  half off my ears a lot of the time to avoid fatiguing and also to be able to hear my surroundings i was fully aware of this when purchasing
but for hard core listening these are perfect and very funalso the tightness that was mentioned is noticeable
as mentioned i wear these properly about half the time
if not worn properly one ear offone on or letting the headphones set higher on the head so you can hear your surroundings i noticed pressure
you just have to wear them in or stretch them a bit and they are perfecti bought these headphones for quality sound and it delivers
i would not rate this lower under any circumstancesomg
these are awesome straight out of the box
no need for burning in
i also own audio technica athm and monster beats studio
these sony mdrv blow em both away
the athms tend to be a bit flat the beats a bit bass heavy
these mdrvs are dynamic and lively along all parts of the spectrum
im hearing notes bravados instrument fades breakbeats that i havent heard before
as i am writing this ive only on hour  of listening
im using my g ipod nano wo an amp imagine with a headphone amp
seriously you wont be disappointed in these
very comfortable quality construction
buy one now the price is right its worth x the price in all seriousnessi love it when someone writes a really good review and i look forward to receiving the item
if you want to be in your own world and hear music in a whole new way get these
you will be so glad you didi absolutely love this headphones
purchased for  back in  and that was big bucks for a engineering college freshman
i loved hifi and dorms were not the placed to drag your equipment
they drowned out the background noise and kept me studying away
i now use them to drown out my children when i telecommutethe sound quality is incredible and the comfort level nd to none
i sometimes felt odd traveling on planes wearing them on air planes etc but this style has come aroundmine the pad has flaked offi hope the new ones hold up the same mine have a rarity now made in japanhighly recommendthese headphones feels like a hifi stereo in the ear
these reproduce amazingly clean clear accurate sound
best headphone till date
i own many in ear onear and over the ear headphones which includes some etymotic sennheiser sony creative panasonic rphtfs klipsch image one brainwavz models and listened to many  models at apple store and best buy
sony mdrv is the best till date
these are not tuned to produce artificial booming bass at the cost of mids and highs
buy them without any hesitation and thank me laterthese are very high quality headphones for about  the cost of the high end onesim using them right now at  am while my wife sleeps in the next roomthe sound quality is a great surprise
made well and fit greatthe best head phones ive ever owned
i read a lot of reviews before i bought theseim very glad that i didmy first experience with these headphones exceeded expectations
you can hear stuff you normally would not hear with cheaper headphones
the bass is incredible with this set and the phones are easily driven using standard computer headphone jacks as well as portable mp players
toss out whatever cheap headphone you currently use and go for these
my only regret was not buying this pair earlieri love these
they accompany my sansa clip perfectly
after burning them in for hours and rockboxing my clip i could not be happier with my  total portable audio solutionsansa clip mdrv
these sound great with ipods as well
bass mids and highs are great for musical scores hip hop electronica big band jazz and classical
great buylet me echo the raves
i just purchased my rd pair
i plug them directly into my access virus kc or minibrute or ultranova or any one of my several instruments and they make me smile
i hear what i play exactly as it sounds on my studio near field monitors
the highs midrange and base sound perfect
the center feels exactly correct and the instruments seem placed exactly where they should be as do the vocals
sometimes i think that the vs are surround sound they are that goodive tried other brands and other sonys as well but for this price im getting a esque pair of cans
i saw them for  on another site
really
thats too much but  years ago i paid  for them and now theyre  on amazon
if you mix music dj or just like listening to music then these are for you
im glad that sony still makes them
my second pair still sounds great but theyre a little ratty for wear
ive replaced the ear pads twice and the headpad is completely wrapped in duct tape and i lost the carrying bag that came with it
so this time i decided to get a new pair just in case sony stops making themthere are better cans out there to be sure but they cost a lot more
i read a few reviews where the reviewers said that theyd found a  pair of phones that were just as good but  thats right they started to list a series of buts like the competetion was a little less comfortable too light or too tight or felt too fragile or the highs were slightly tinny or weak mids or the bass bottomed out
well none of that for the vs
highly recommendedthese are great classic cans
ive had them for a month and started using them after a few days burnin when these vs were plugged in  to a receiver in another room at upper moderate volume level
and this is what i would recommend to everyone before evaluating their sound  play them nonstop for about  hours without listening and then you will start to hear their bestthey fit my large head perfectly and sound lovely
bass goes low down to hz but its not boomy or distorted or overbearing in any way
from a good recording all you hear is a clean low punchthe only one thing i would improve is the vinyl ear surrounds
i might get a pair of black cotton baby head bands to wrap around the vinyl donutsif you get them for around sixty shipped then its a good dealpurchased these headphones in   i was impressed with their sounded quality
the digital music era was becoming the norm back then and these made cds sound really good compared to other headphones that were available at the time
since  i have replaced the ear pads twice but the sound quality is just as impressive today
their response is flat allowing you to hear every small nuance in your music even at low volumes
the comfort level is good i have no issues when wearing them for extended periods of time
when i got these it was not a purchased i thought through completely impulse buy i never imagined they would hold up as well as they have for so long and more importantly sustain their sound quality as they continue to
no regrets from this very satisfied ownerthese sony mdrv headphones are very impressive
ive been using a pair of ontheear sony mdrs with a frequency response of hz to hz that i got for  in the s
the vs are clearly better
deeper and richer bass significantly better clarity
the sound is precise and delicate
i can understand lyrics better with these phones
my yamaha p electric piano sounds much nicer too
it has excellent samples and i can hear a significant difference with the vs compared to the s
do note however you need a quality source to hear this difference
most portable mp players dont even take full advantage of my mdrs
im listening to my msi gmp motherboard with a via chipset a quality portable cd player and my yamaha pianosome people scoff at the idea of headphones with a response to  hertz since most humans cant hear above  hz
what they dont understand is that while the typical adult human cant hear a pure tone above khz headphones or speakers that can produce a khz tone will sound more clear and precise at frequencies lower than khz which we can hear
we cant hear the pure tone but we can hear sharp changes in lower frequencies sharp changes that can only be produced by a speaker capable of khzaroundtheear headphones are superior in two ways  by putting pressure on the side of the head rather than the ear lobe they are far more comfortable especially if you wear glasses
i can wear these for hours with no discomfort
and  they make a better seal around the ear which allows better bassmy only criticism is that there should be a label or at least a mention in the manual saying that the headphones may need a few hours of loud music to wear in and until they do one side or the other may have lower volume
at first i worried they were defective because the left side was significantly quieter
i imagine that many people have returned them as defective because of thisthese headphones have great sound reproduction
i also have a medium to large head and they are comfortable
i have not had any issues with the stock pads making my ears sore
they also cup the ears nicely so they cut out a good amount of outside noise
these are totally worth the  or so i paid for them
the sound is comparable to headphones double the pricethe sony mdrv monitor headphones are the predecessor of the professional industry standard mdr studio headphonessony mdr professional large diaphragm headphonethat i use as a sound mixer and recordist in the film and television production industry
for my full thoughts on the  click the link above and look for that reviewthe two models are virtually identical
the v phones were originally released as a high end headphone to appeal to audiophiles who were on a budget
they feature closed ear design with soft lamb skin ear pads smooth frequency response and a bass boost popular with djs and contemporary music loversthe main differences between the two are that the  phones come with gold tipped plugs and a sticker that says professional on it
the v has a sticker that says simply digital and the plugs are standard silverand the mdrv phones are usually about  cheaper than their professional model
all in all either model will sound great for whatever purpose you choose to use them for
highly recommendedi like these a lot and i decided to go with a wired setup for my night time home theater watching
it sucks some times having a wire but sound quality is good and i was able to get two of these for a good bit cheaper than the one set of wireless ones i was looking atpros excellent sound reproduction
price
durability my original pair has survived  international trips and almost everyday usage for over a year now comfortable
long cordjust brought another one to be kept at workplaceif youre looking for a comfortable headset with superior sound without having to spend an arm and leg this is it
i especially like the comfortable fit allowing my my ears to fit snugly inside
comes with a nice storage bag tooi have been searching for a pair of headphones or iem earphones for more than six months
i ordered a pair of jh audio jhj pro custom iems for  complete with an  visit to an audiologist for ear canal impressions
one fitted and the other did not
the sound was excellent in the one that sealed well but when  the whole thing was a very bad experience and the iems were eventually returned after three attempts to get both to fit my ear canalsi then ordered a pair of sennheiser hd  headphones  the sound was magnificent right out of the box but the hard ear pads were painful
sennheiser customer service said they would soften with use but for  for the hd s i was not willing to chance it and returned themnext came the sennheiser ie  iems again with excellent sound
however there was so much microfonics with any head movement they too were returnedi tried the best denons flagship model at the time and found them to be uncomfortable
the same was true with a pair of  grados also uncomfortablei had given up until i found a pair of  iems and have been using them for a few months
after deciding to try headphones again i ran across the sony mdrv headphones
they had good reviews and i ordered themtoday was the first day that i listened to music and tv with the mdrvs they are quite comfortable but do not quite fit over my ears well enough thoughi do not classify myself as an audiophile but right out of the box the mdrvs sound good
they will be burned in using music and pink noise during the next few months but they sound is very acceptable
they are well balanced over the frequency range with no discernible distortion
the base is very adequate even for me basshead tendenciesthey do not equal the hd s or the ie s but the mdrvs do not cost  or even  either
they have values in spades
try them i believe youll like them especially considering their remarkably low pricei bought this one during blackfriday  to be used together with my iphone  i am not a professional in headphones but this one meets all my basic needs in daily use at the appropriate pricethe sony mdrv is a terrific headphone at a great pricepointi think its a great compromise between comfort and sound
ive used them as a professional video sound recorded and for my personal music and sound editing purposes
they are ruggedone of my pet peeves is the ear pads fall off headphones and the mdrv doesnt have a problem with this
they are compact and light but still have great sound
my musician friend says theyre a recording standarddont know if this is a fact but i could believe it
highly recommendedi purchased these sony mdrv headphones for myself for my birthday
these upgraded a similar style circumaural of  headphones
i thought my old headphones were good but these new sonys are fantastic
at  dbmw sensitivity the mm driver provides ample sound volume
the ear cuffs isolate outside noise wellpros linear frequency response
bass through treble sound vivid balanced solid construction
metal headband many screws comfortable to wear flexible telephone cord is a plus came with large stereo jack adaptor folds compactly in faux
leather drawstring bagcons my old phones had a manual slide volume adjustment on the cord the sony doesnt the headband musses up my hairim quite satisfied with these headpones for their sensitive expressive accurate efficient sound reproductioni wanted to retire my mdrvs to my computer and get the studio monitor vs for the hifi
i was a bit put off by the highs at first until i turned off my hifis equalizer
going flat and uncolored these headphones are superb
i love them
they are smaller lighter than the vs and sound better to bootsurprisingly my mother insisted on my ordering a pair for her as well
the fit and sound appealed to her for playing the organ with headphones or listening to music cdsi highly recommend these headphones especially at this price pointa return to my original reviewit is may  and i have had these cans for a spell
the longer i own my sony studio monitors the more i adore them
there is nothing like a flat and uncolored pair of monitor headphones for pure musical enjoyment as music is meant to be heard
but dont let that lull you into thinking these phones lack power beefy low notes or lack a wonderful subtlety in the solidity of the low end
the fact is cranked up they will make your ears bleed
their power requirement is also low that i have even used them on an antique radio whos volume is not much louder than a crystal radioi still highly recommend these headphonesive had these headphones for almost two years
the ear pads are pretty close to needing to be replaced which wont be expensive at all but other than that these are as good as the day i bought them
im no audiophile the sound is very good but what i love is the comfort
i wear these for upwards of seven hours a day and they are fantastically cushy
the only con i have is that the chord is very long and heavy with the coils so it hangs off of my computer desk and i can just feel the weight of it especially when i move my head
my next pair will be wireless and probably noise canceling so i dont have to listen to my idiot roommate talk to his gamer friendsone of my favorite possessionsi did months of research on the internet and asking around to friends in the audio industry and kept coming back to these headphones
it seems sony did something right  years ago and hasnt strayed from the formula since
this set looks good fits well and sounds great
they definitely need a few hours to loosen up to get their best sound but its worth it
i feel like i hear everything when im listening to music
they block out outside sound well enough for methe cups are comfortable and large enough for my ears
they are highly durable im not afraid to throw them around a little bit or even stuff them into my backpack
the coiled cord can get heavy at times
i wish it was more of a flat cord and had a cord wrangler like my old sennheiser hds a good lowend set but if it helps it sound they way it does im more than okay with itthere is the higherendmarketed sony mdr but these are basically the same
some detailed reviews reveal only slight differences in the two sets response patterns but its hardly noticeable
the only real difference is that the  has a goldtipped jack whereas the v does not
one reviewer noted that if the set was going to be plugged and unplugged repeatedly ie
not installed in a studio setting the gold plating could eventually wear off
as i take my set on the go and plug into various devices this was fine with meyou cannot find a better set of headphones for under 
i would recommend these to anybody that likes musicthis headphones are amazing the sound is really good and the quality of the product is excellent this headphones are really comfortable and it didnt weight too muchuse these in my studio and they work great
can pump a lot of volume through these without them distortingim was so sick of earbuds that i treated myself to these headphones
only had them a week but ive already realized what ive been missing
the only issue i had was that on the imac there was no easy way of switching between built in speakers and headphones when the headphones were plugged into the headphone jack
solution was to get a usb adapter from an old pair of logitechs and now i can easily switch by a single click on the menu bar
highly recommended and im seriously considering a second pair to use in workwhat i wanted fullrange uncolored headphones
my intention was to use for monitoring in the recording studio and for silent bass guitar practice
i noticed that the tv studio where i work used sony s
i discovered that the mdrv are nearly identical
i ordered them and ab them with the  only to discover that i could not tell the difference
both were excellentwhich brings me to audio quality
they are sonically invisible
i put them on and suddenly by the resonance of the kick drum i can hear the shape of the room bonnie raitts drummer was in when he recorded i will not be broken
these headphones are full flat uncolored and clear
theyre perfect for what i wantto hear as faithfully as possiblei have owned these headphones for just over a year and ive used them almost every day
no wear or mechanical problems to reportthese are great headphonesi work in the music industry and for the price point i would rather buy these versus any of the higher price sony mdr modelssonys earphone headphone are usually heavily tuned or heavily colored
but this is not the case for mdr v
after  years of use it still remain one of the best ear phones i ever hadhowever
the ear cushions can easily be worn out maybe because i have eye glasses
i cant find a replacement
any ideasi knew i was getting something neat just by looking at the brand and all the possitive reviews
these headphones rule they feel very durable and the sound is just greatdid you hear that
nothen you clearly dont have these
joke aside these are wonderful and clear as day when listening to any form of music by headhunterzbasskick or the eaglesepic crisp guitar
no need to get expensive headphone into the hundreds when these are right here
i have worked with a few friends of mine in the norwayeast europe techno circuit and these are the on the go top rated headphones for when the melody starts nocking in your head and you need to get it into the computer as fast as you can with as much clarity as you can
personally i would rate these from home hobby to professional producesas a travel or monitoring aspect and leave the real high ends for live studioover km
so in short you get these and your mix comes alive with terrible sounds that your old headphones missedwhich in the by the end of the day will sound crisp and colorful thanks to sonys mdrvsat this late date i dont have much to add to many of the great preceding reviews
i have a set of bose headphones with which i listen mostly to music when working at my deskcomputer and a sony mdrv mainly for when i am watching tv that i have had for nearly  years and it is still going strong that is why i purchased this second set  and the price was too attractive to ignorethroughout the years i could not tell any difference in sound quality or clarity and since rap music is not to my musical taste i have no issue with the bass notes as stated by other reviewersare you kidding me
these are nice
i did alot of research and admittidly these did not have the most universally poitive reviews in the sub bracket
i have a big head and these feel like a feather on me
especially compared to my logitech g gamers
which are not comfortable at all
the sound on these are clear and crisp
there on my head now and i actually had forgotten for a few minutes
my biggest concern was they would hurt and they dont at all
i love the cord
the fold up feature is nice and they sit compact on my desk unlike the gs
i have not tried any other cans so my experience is obviously limited and the group has some other highly rated headphones
the grado sr at ad and the s all get good reviews
good luck chosing if you have to
these are very nice imothe  things that all great headphones have in common are durability sound quality comfort durability  this may very well be the most important factor of headphones
by definition headphones are meant to be portable
everyone at one time or another has thrown their headphones into a backpack or laptop case
headphones generally need to be replaced only when they break or get misplaced
the mdrv are just about the most durable things ive ever seen
its classic sony construction
mostly made of metal and thick in the vulnerable parts these are built to last
in addition they collapse to a nice compact shape further enhancing portability and durability
the coiled cord is also designed to last
think telephone cord
so unless you have a pet who insists on chewing things the cord will never be the reason you replace these
finally they come with a bag for even more durability
if you are even considering the bose triports slap yourself sober now
i can snap the triports with  fingers sound quality  the sony digital line of headphones have been the standard for audio clarity for decades
so if youre jaded by past experiences with nondigital line of sony headphones dont be
these are on par with the newer highdefinition line of sony headphones
digital sound by nature is tinny
but these headphones give equal clarity and attention to the low and mid frequencies
i often listen to classical music and woodwinds bass and percussions glisten through these headphones
i also use these for hiphop rock pop jazz and everything under the sun except country
these headphones excel across all genres
now with the obligatory comparison to the bose triports
with bose triports i have to really exert myself to isolate instruments and sounds
the mdrv isolate sounds for you
you can just sit back and enjoy the show
in addition bose triports sound like your listening underwater when compared to the mdrvs
once again  the price more than x the performance
mdrvs dominate this category comfort these are ontheear heaphones
not aroundtheear
these require careful placement on your ears
for maximum comfort place as much of the pad directly on the fattest parts of your earlobe
i know it sounds counterintuitive but place them a bit forward on your ears
if placed properly these are as comfortable as any set of headphones ive ever owned
i have a really big head and these headphones with a tight headband give me no problems on even  hour flights
like any ontheear headphones you will need to move them around to discover what is most comfortable for you but once you find your sweet spot these are as comfortable as you will ever needforget bangforthebuck
these are great headphones no matter what price range your consider
sennheuser audiotechnica bose or whatever brand you are consideringstop right here and click add to cart
you wont be disappointedthese are time tested phones that i feel shine in the rock genre
a healthy bass and clear highs bring out the bottom without clouding the topthese are so much better than headset in their price range they are a nobrainer
if youre a beatz from dre fan obviously you dont really care about sound quality so keep on moving
the reason the normals want these is because were looking for great quality sound under  that wont leak all over the roomthe build quality is exemplary
there is metal all over this thing
when you compare it to the plastic stuff out there they feel like toys
these are passive noise cancelling but are super comfy and just completely seal you away from the worldi thought they were too big and wanted to send them back
i tried to replace them with other headsets and eventually saw why there are  reviews mostly positivejust buy them even to test the hype
youre probably going to be underwhelmed at first
then compare them with all the other headphones in the price range you think will be better
youll keep these and probably add your own positive reviewits nice to know they are durable and will last a very long time
i love these things full stopi used to use a set of these headphones back when i did some minor video production work and was always impressed by their full range and sound quality
i am not an audiophile nor will i act like an expert in sound quality but i am very pleased with these headphones
i have been plodding along with some old koss headphones on my gaming rig and they were clearly at the end of their long life
i have a nice little  surround setup for my computer to play games with but when the wife goes to bed i have to plug in the ear cans
going from all of the glorious booms and rumbles i get with the sub attached to my  system to the lack luster sound of my old headphones was jarring
well i can say that this is no longer a problem with these sony headphones
these produce a full range of sound that makes me forget i am wearing headphones instead of listening to my full speaker set
not overpowering on the low end and not too tinty on the high
as for the comfort on the head some have said they dislike them but i have no complaints
i wear glasses which can be problematic for extended periods of time with some headphones but so far these dont bother me at all even after  hours of continuous wear
if anything the only problem i have with these is that they block out the sound so well around me that i cant hear when my wife comes into the room
she was trying to talk to me the other night and i had no idea she was speaking which may get me in trouble one of these daysi have a set of sennheiser  headphones and i must say these do have more detail and clarity
they are very comfortable to wear
i highly recommend them
they are also very efficient doesnt take a lot of power to drive them
i bought the beyerdynamic edt  velour ear cushions to put on them and did they make a difference
very comfortablei have had these headphones since about   i cant think of one other piece of electronics that i still own and use
the bass on these are so phenomenal but its not overpowering
you hear every piece of every piece of music
highs are also excellent
these are the one thing that sounded better than my exspeakers klipsch kgs
the only thing i have replaced is the ear coverings themselves
otherwise just as perfect as ever and very comfortable to boot
youll love them if you buy thembased on the reviews thought id give this babe a try and boy have i been impressed
i tried them with my iphone  and they sounded good
but when i lost my iphone i used my gb zune player that i got from my daughter as she got an ipod and then i turned on the eq setting
man i heard sounds i never heard before from a stereo or headphones
the bass was awesome and i could hear the words much better
words i never knew what the singer was singing
so folks it depends on your player for some awesome sounding bass
im not sure if there is eq app for iphone but i will check when i get my replacement in a couple of months or some other phone if there is an eq on the phone doubt it though may be surprised
there ear pad on my left ear hurt a little at first after a little while but i adjusted the head band so it took most of the weight on top of my head and that worked
good luck in finding your headphones
i found my babei studied everything on the market and shopped all around for the best product i could find
i was told to look for the greatest frequency response on the market
these headphones have a frequency response of  hz   khz
i found that i could have gotten a lower rated hz but at a cost of over 
that was not an acceptable price for my budgetthese headphones are very comfortable reasonably priced have a longer cord than absolutely necessary have adapters for different size plugs and outstanding quality of sound
what more do you want

thanks again amazon 
best choice ever after window shopping at a bunch of stores and testing countless headphones i decided to settle on this particular set for the sound quality
the sound is amazing and definitely worth the money
i only wish i couldve gotten a little bit more bass out of it but i can complain too much due to the other aspects of this headphonei had the mdrvs in the early sloved them but for some dumb reason replaced them with mdrvs
i was never happy with the vs and now  years later just replaced them with the mdrv
right out of the boxinstant clarity deep accurate bass an articulate musical sound
not sure what the v has that makes it so goodi was looking for headphone with high fidelity and surprise i got it at a reasonable price its the best i ever  buy comfort ear cups are very comfortable and dont make my ears or head ache after hours of use headband is flexible and doesnt hurt my head in any way
other reviewers complained of these being uncomfortable and too tight but i have not experienced this at all
my head is large btw
 aplus on comfort cord long and coiled thick and durable a bit bulky for desktop computer or phone use connector thick and solid all metal design sound outstanding
best ive ever heard deep bass music is rich and beautiful podcasts are so clear its like being in the studio compared to other headphones because of the range ive noticed that i must turn down the volume on these when doing comparisons
 im not an audiophile but these headphones are making me a more discerning listener
 storageprofile lightweight for carrying folds up nicely for travel sound cancelling some sound leaks in but these generally block outside noise to an acceptable degree sound does not easily leak out other thoughts i use headphones daily and wear them out with constant use
after years of inferior headphones i decided to give these a try and spend more money for the quality
im expecting a lot
so far so good
 i have a pair of drbt bluetooth headphones and because of my positive experience with them i decided to give these a try
so far i am not disappointedi already own a pair of these sony mdrv series headphones  enjoy them very much
i bought these as a second pair since sony discontinued them
these replacement  headphones sound exactly as my other sony mdrv headphones
hope these last me as long as my other pair which are now ten years old
these headphones offered by amazon are worth the price i paidwith over  reviews on these why add yet another
aw what the hecki purchased my first pair of mdrvs when they first came out in the s
you need to realize that a driver that could faithfully reproduce sound down to and below hz was unheard of in consumer audio at that time
these phones stunned me when i was able to hear content on certain recordings that i had never heard before  mostly in the spectrum from hz and down
this was an unusual experience via headphones
the clarity and truthfulness of the audio the mdrvs produce is stunning to those who value accurate audio reproduction
their ability to deliver very high volume levels without distortion is a joy in moderation  doing this too often will result in hearing loss
they are even more stunning when one considers the price compared to the more esoteric audiophile phones available that can run  to  times more in pricei had that first pair of phones for about  years before someone stepped on the frame and snapped one of the drivers clean off
i replaced them with a new pair which i still own
they are pushing  years old now and still sound very good
after an estimated  hours of use the ear pads are flaking off and the left driver had begun to occasionally breakup on high volume low frequency content
so i have ordered my third pair of these beauties over the course of almost  years
thank you sony for continuing to manufacture this excellent product at an amazing pricea popular trend in headphone design today involves intentional gain manipulation over certain frequencies  mostly on the low end beats by dr dre
if they sound good to you who am i to tell you different
i personally enjoy hearing recordings as close to their original mix as possible
the mdrvs do that extremely well
when you can actually hear the full audio spectrum delivered with very little coloration you might be surprised at how enjoyable some recordings are with little or no adjustments to the equalizationthe only shortcoming on these phones is the fact that the wire that runs from the left ear cup up and over to the right ear cup is exposed where it travels over the stainless steel band on each side
this is a pretty small gauge wire and if you accidentally pulled on it when removing the earphones or pulling them out of a backpack there is a possibility of the wire being damaged
and if that wire is ever broken it is basically impossible to repair
nearly all headphones use very fine stranded coated wiring
the coating makes it practically impossible to repair once broken
it cannot be soldered or twisted together
so if you are rough with your phones consider thisif accuracy is important to you look no further
buy these then buy a backup pairive been using various sony headphones throughout my  years on this planet and have always been more than happy with them but ive always just stuck with the cheaper models
recently i decided to buy some new headphones
i tried out some other brands such as sennheiser but in the end i decided to come home to sonythis is the first time ive bought a pair of headphones in this price range and all i can say is i wish i had spent the money on these years ago
i had no idea what i was missing
the sound is very smooth yet precise the bass response is just right and the highs are not overly bright like the sennheisers i triedive generally never cared for overtheear cans most ones ive tried either squeezed my head or irritated my ears but these are super comfortable
ive been wearing them all day in fact im listening to them right now and although my ears are a tiny bit sweaty after wearing them all day they are still perfectly comfortablefor those of you that are on the fence about stepping up to the  price range i would say you absolutely need to get these
they are worth every pennya little on the large side but the sound is very good
a great value for the price
i am glad i got these
sure beats little ear buds in sound qualityi picked these up during black friday on sale
being a long time believer in sony headphones and a long time user of the now retired vs i knew i was going to get a quality product
these headphones have surpassed my expectations they are light very comfortable and the near field sound is perfect for a alt
production reference
these headphones are worth  every day of the week and if you catch them on sale like i did you win even moremy dad bought a pair of these in the late s
i remember being a preteen at the time and thinking they were the best sounding headphones or speaker for that matter that id ever heard at the time
my dad still has his and i actually picked up a pair of replacement pads as his had long disintegrated
found the pads for real cheap on a website mentioned in one of these reviews
his sounds just as good as they did new  years ago
i grabbed these for an awesome black friday price
these sound incredible such detail with just the right level of bass for me anyway
now if youre in to xtreme bass youll probably want to look for something thats marketed in that direction as these are not over the topcomfort wise they get a little warm on the ears after a while but theyre enclosed over your ears so what headphones wouldnt
as far as fitting too tight blame that on your mother and father for giving birth to someone with too big of a head
these are very comfortable and i can easily go a couple hours at a time in thesebeautiful sounds on instrumental rock techno classicalanything reallyive listened to the ultrasone hfi sony mdrv mdr grado sri and the sennheiser hd
the hd winsthe ultrasone hfi has absolutely terrible sibilancesibilant
this is a common complaint with these cans
the  has better bass than the hd but the sibilance ruins these cans
not even listenablethe sony mdrv aka mdr are phenomenal cans but rather boring
these are some of the most popular headphones ever made for good reason
they do sound incredible and they are inexpensive
every sound is fantastic
however it can be boring for people who are not used to it
people in the audio industry refer to them as flat and flat is the perfect way to describe them
and some people love this sound it grows on you after a while
the mdrv are studio monitors which mean they are primarily made to be used in a studio or with other professional applications where you can monitor how loud a particular sound is
these cans heavily emphasize the mids and thats not necessarily a bad thing
those who love acoustic music or love hearing vocals will prefer these over the hd
some treble and some hissing can be heard on occasion but overall these are amazing headphones if you like flat sound
the bass is very nice and never muddles the midrange or treble
isolation is actually really good
i do have a problem with the left side of the headphone
if i move my head at all and i mean at all a part of the headband makes a swearing sound
i fixed it by wrapping some material around it
an easy fix but i should not have had to do this
these cans provide excellent detail but can also be unforgiving on recordings that are subpar
overall excellent phones and i highly recommend them to everyonethe grado sri are another great set of headphones but they are uncomfortable and dont appear to be made as well as the other headphones on this list
overall they sound great
the bass is almost nonexistent like the hd
the overall sound signature was not as clean as the mdrv
the mdrv is just so clean and precise very hard to beat
but the sri are still great headphones and i would probably prefer to listen to music and game with them more than the sonys
the grados sound like what you are used to which is not studio monitor headphonesnow the sennheiser hd
i have the least experience with these but they are so good i dont need extensive experience
they are extremely comfortable excellent sound reproduction and excellent soundstage
ive listened to many gaming headphones in the  price range and these are several tiers above them in every way
soundstage is so important in gaming especially first person shooters
i use these with battlefield  and they always accurately pinpoint all the sounds
music is crystal clear and silky smooth
no sibilance or harshness ever hear
i do wish they had more bass but the open nature of these cans makes these bass light
well made and sound great for an affordable priceive had earphones that were onear earbud overear and whatever else is available
this was my first circumaural set of headphones and the fit was much better for longer uses than any of the other
the bass surprised me at first with how distinct it was probably as good as any desktop speakers ive had
the cord is long so i can move around my desk a bit with pulling on the plug
and of course the sound quality is great
the fact the padding goes around the ear and sits on the head also gives it implicit noise reduction so you can get a lot more out of whatever youre listening to without having to jack up the volume
overall i was very impressed by these headphones and would highly recommend themi bought a set of these to replace an old set of mdrv i had that were falling apart
these are great phones for the price
very light good reproductions comfortable to wear
the headband padding is not quite so thickly padded as the v but good enough
im sure there are audiophiles who can rip on their response in this or that frequency but for my money these are the best in their price rangeim no audiophile but i have to say that these are easily the best pair of headphones i have ever had
at first i thought they were ok but then i read that you have to wear them in so i just played music that had heavy bass and distortion for a little while
not sure if thats the way to break them in but it worked
after that its been smooth sailingi do have to agree that the earphones do get a bit tiring to wear after a while
one can easily switch them out but i dont care that much since i only wear them a couple of hours a dayas for the music itself it is very very clear
i can hear things i have never heard before
the bass is actually thumping each guitar chord is heard and minute noises are distinct
great set of headphones and i would totally invest in another pairgreat sound durable comfortable and very reasonably priced
i purchased these in  and have not regretted my decision once
i like these headphones so much that whenever a friend or coworker is looking for a new pair of headphones i immediately recommend these ones
i think  of my fiends have also purchased them after trying them
i even had a friend exchange his beats for thesewhat i likegreat sound profile with just the right amount of basecomfortable i can wear these for hours without having to take them off or adjust themlong coiled cord because of the coil design it is only a couple of feet long which makes it manageable
if you need it longer it easily stretches but not strains to several more feetcomes with an adapter this comes in handy when i need to plug them into my receiverbecause of the over the ear design of the headphones they block out sound nicely
i can use them on an airplane without having to crank up the volume and or losing quality because of the ambient noise
they also do a good job blocking out ambient noise in coffee shops and long road trips in the carwhat i dont like maybe a little bulky to wear in public but that hasnt stopped me from using it on mass transitbuy them you will not be disappointedive been using these since they first came out
i was a recording engineer at the time and a friend who was a boom man on movies turned me on to them
i have tried many other headphones over the years but these have always been and continue to be the gold standard
some may not find them as comfortable as other brands but they get better over time and the sound quality is definitely worth the investment
when these first came out they were put in sonys consumer line but as does happen in audio the pros got turned on to them and before long they were outselling the headphones in sonys pro line who complained loudly o
sony then introduced the  into the pro line and charged more money for them 
i remember for a while it was hard to find the vs
but apparently so many professionals complained that eventually sony made the vs available again
i dont use these to listen to my ipod for several reasons number one they are highly accurate
while that sounds good what it really means they are very flat in their response no presence boost no bass boost zip nada
that may make them seem dull when compared to other headphones but in essence for a professional who is trying to capture audio accurately it is a blessing
the second reason is they are too big to fit in a pocket with your ipod
when done listening i wrap my etymotics around my ipod and shove the whole thing in my coat pocket no worries
even if you fold these guys up youll have a tough time getting them in all but the largest pockets
one final thing i can add that has nothing to do with the use of the headphones per se is the bag that comes with these is a pos
i learned early on that they rip flake and basically fall apart
when my first one disintegrated that same movie sound man turned me onto the perfect replacement a crown royal bag
the headphones fit perfectly and  years later im still using the same bag
leave it to the liquor folks to outdo the audio manufacturers when it comes to quality packaging
d enjoy as i said i have for over two decades now
michaeli had these headphones since around  its been so long ago
i work as digital artist so these headphones are being used  hours a week for the past  years
they still work as good as the day i got them
i have dropped these headphones countless of times and there is little to no damage
the only thing i had to replace is the earpiece as they become flaky after years of use
i would recommend these to any who wants a great set of headphones and dont want to pay overrated high price for some others
there must be a reason why people are still buying the mdrv that have not been discontinued yet
really a great set of headphonesi bought my first pair of these in  and am still using them
i am so paranoid that one day sony will cease their production ive purchased several pairs so ill have them up until i die
its a testament to their quality that sports broadcasters music producers djs and other professionals needing optimum sound quality continue to use these
what impresses me the most is the bass reproduction and high end timbres
im telling you many years ago when sony would roll out new models of headphones i would spend  to  times as much as this pair thinking that the quality would be a step up
that was never the case
these headphones have stood the test of time and i cannot recommend them highly enough
they are durable and reproduce voice music anything with a clarity that is unrivaledpurchased these as a replacement for a set of sony mdrs over  years old that my daughter recently had the distinct pleasure of breaking
i am by no means an audiophile but i could immediately tell the difference in sound quality over any headphones i have ever used
these are way more comfortable and seemingly a lot higher quality as well
sometimes i put them on just to drown out the ambient noise as they work beautifully at isolating external sound
i also love the fact that you can replace just the cups when they wear down
im very happy with this purchase and feel that these are top of the line
additionally my brother feels seems to think these perform better than his beats by dre headphones i personally never jumped on that bandwagon
overall a great product at a great price
would recommend all day longive enjoyed using this model of sony headphones for more years than i can count
my older set has been restored with fresh ear pads and this newer set shares the same excellent sound quality comfort and workmanship
highly recommendedfirst off my initial impression of this headphone was astonishment
the build quality all the way down to the solid way the headphone clicks into place when you extend each side was superb
also the fit was very good i am  with a muscular build and they cover my ears finewhen i put them on i immediately noticed how quiet everything was even with music playing low volume i couldnt even hear myself typing this review on my very loud razer blackwidow keyboard that clicks every time you strike a keythe v is an older design more than  years old and it shows
persoanlly though i like the design and the look
its very different from the allplastic designs common to other inexpensive sony headphones
the headband is wrapped in pleather with minimal padding
lengthadjustable metal strips attach the earpieces to the headband
the driver housings are of black metal a plus
the cups are covered in crinkled pleather
the coiled cord is one meter long at rest but extends to three and attaches to the left earpiece
the plug is a mini the  adapter included screws on to prevent accidental extraction
both plug and adapter are nickel plated rather than gold like the more expensive mdr  basically the same headphone with different stickers gold plating on the jack and an extended warranty which is the only visible sign of the vs relatively low price bracket
the v folds in the manner of some of sonys other headphones that is the ear pieces swing up under the band to form a more compact package
after this treatment the v fits into the black pleather bag it comes withsince the range is so large hzkhz you can hear everything including the distortion of not well leveled sound
but thats whey these were made for the studio and not really for personal listening
i am really glad that whenever i download songs i make sure they are kbps or above
you can really hear any subtle nuances of instruments in the backround which is really an added plus
so if you get these headphones make sure your music files are up to pari cannot believe that that these headphones are under  and even further disbelief that i did not buy these earlier they are one of the best headphones i have ever put on
forget beats go oldschool and get these studio monitorsokay these arnt all perfect by now my ears are getting a bit warm lack of ventilation but i guess that comes with any over ear headphones
also with thourough research i found that the padding flakes off the leather isnt real but they can be replaced for under  bucks
another padding that fits is the padding of beyer dt headphones which some say are a bit more comfortable but i like these fine
these vs last a very very long time and is a great investment
i highly suggest it you wont regret italso a friend told me to let these play for a couple hours on high volume to break them in
she also has these but for me they play fine righto out of the boxfirst off im not an audiophile
this will horrify some people but im not all that picky when it comes to sound
im happy listening to movies and tv through my tvs speakers though to be fair i always try to buy a tv with good sound
im content with the headphones that come with my ipodthat sort of thingso on the audio front my opinion probably doesnt mean that much
that said i could instantly tell that the sound on these was far better than my ipod headphones
its as good as anything i can recall hearingthats actually not why i bought these though
i work in a very loud environment
it seems to be over db and ive long been concerned that it might be wrecking my hearing
ive tried using the ear protection gear i wear while mowing but its just not comfortable for long periods
i finally started wondering if a good pair of headphones that enclose your ears would helpand as it turns out they do
these cut a significant amount of noise out to the point that im pretty sure they really are helpful for my hearing
not as much as the actual hearing protection stuff but the difference in noise when i take them off after wearing them for a while is hugei was also concerned about how comfortable these would be given the mixed reviews in terms of comfort
at least for me these are very comfortable
ive been wearing them every day  hours a day and have no complaints
i can feel them if i think about it but the cushioning is soft and comfortable and to me they just feel like theyre gripping my head lightlynot unlike how a hat feels i guess
for the record i wear glasses and these dont interfere with them at all
so at any rate they seem very well built they sound great to my ear theyre comfortable and they seem to block a substantial amount of noise
theyre one of the few products that i can recommend wholeheartedlywell i guess just to nitpick the size adjustments on the side dont always stay in the same spot from where they were when i took them off the previous day but thats really no big deal
they do have size adjustments though which is worth noting
i have a big headfinding hats that fit is very very hard but these fit just fine so i think theyd work for most peoplesuper high quality sound and for the price they can not be beaten
my friends all agreed these were the best headphones they have ever listened toif anyone tells you this are bad headphones they are lying to you big time
this are some pretty good pair of headphonesprossound is quite amazing everything pretty vivid on them a lil to high on the high freqs but its okay i like themthey dont hurt your ears or crush your ears you can wear them nicely for a few hours not more than  without removing them a lil bit for your ears to fresh outvery well made its aluminium not cheap plastic like headphones this days feels pretty sturdy and look quite coolcomes with a carrying bag which is fake leather or something doesnt feel that good but its a plus so you can carry your headphones around they also fold so its easier to carryisolation is amazing at even half the full volume it doesnt leak at allconsdont wear them for more then  hours in a row without taking them off a few minutes thats itim really happy with them i recommend it to anybody who wants to listen his music how it shouldi got the mdrv as a gift and have had it for half a yearthe sound quality is best of all headphones ive usedits a bit uncomfortable because i wear prescription glasses
i have to take it off and relief my head after half hours listening
but its just a minor inconveniencepeople who dont have eye glasses should have no issue at alli dont know whether or not its the mdrvdjs mm drivers or the mdrvs mm drivers that makes the slight difference in sound
both of these are excellent headphones
although the mdrv are an excellent choice and an industry standards i thought the sound was a tad bit less full sounding than the mdrvdjs
it may just be that the sound pressure level 
was greater on the mdrvs since they have larger drivers
i am very impressed with both headphones and i will most likely be doing the mastering of my musical projects with both headphones as well as with my monitoring speakers event project studio  monitors excellentthese headphones are great
the quality is amazing and the sound is crisp and clear
the style is professional and mature not flashy
after trying on my friends headphones like beats skullcandys or dnas ive always felt that the sony mdrvs were better
they give you the sound that music artists want you to hear
most recording studios use these headphones or the mdr  which i havent tried yetthe sturdiness of these headphones are amazing
ive stepped on them sat on them dropped them
and theyre still fineif youre looking for affordable highquality headphones you must get these or the mdrsive had my mdrvs so long i cant remember when i bought them
at that time they were highly recommended
they still are
that should tell you something
second recommendation  do you watch any concerts via dvd
ever notice performers wearing a traditional set of headphones
those pros are often wearing mdrvs  theyre distinctive with a red horizontal stripe across the back of each drivertwo issues vinyl coating that flakes off the ear cups when it happens just peel the rest off
the fuzzy fabric beneath ends up being more comfortable than the vinyl since it breathes and your ears stay coolerelectrostatic discharge zaps to your ears in a dry wintry environment  i fixed that by removing one ear cup and attached a fine brass wire loop that i grounded to the neutral wire that serves the l  r drivers
this fine wire shows  is visible inside the ear cup
in use this rests on my ear not detectable as pressure on the ear and constantly drains off any static electricity buildup
bottom line no more zapsso ya want great headphones
buy em and enjoy emi owned the originals a couple of decades ago and was very pleased with them
these are virtually the identical head phones
my only complaint is that the very supple ear covers had a small slit right near the edge
this does not take away from my listening experience so i still gave them  stars
the sound quality is still excellent full range and neutral
i will always own a set of these
i was planning to buy the beyerdynamic edt  ear cushions anywayi have had a pair of these headphones for about  years
i have just bought another pair of these
before i bought my second pair i tried bose and sennheiser headphones
some of them cost more than  per pair but nothing beats these old sony headphones in sound qualitythis is probably the best money i have ever spent on
i originally bought a pair of v at best buy ten years ago
yes ten years later they are still functioning well except the ear pad falling off and i replaced the ear pad
it sounds still amazing compare to a lot of phones i got in recent years  bose even compare to bw this is definitely worth the sony brand
highly recommendedexcellent sound of course these lack the base that we have in the new headphone we have now but ill still pick these over a beat or bosethe only thing i dont like is the long very long wire which make them more for home use headphonenice picture quality and easy to use
this unit doesnt include the external power supply so i would buy one or a card reader for downloading the photos to your pc  or if you are buying a photo printer too the hp  models   have a built in card reader
downloading drains the  batteries quickly
i like the color lcd for reviewing your pictures and  the megapixel resolution produces nice photo quality shots with good  detailmine was manufactured in march  and according to the original owner was used pretty much daily
i have this beauty now and with an hdtv converter connected via the available composite inputs this set still outperforms modern hdtvs on every picture criteria other than raw resolution
my friends cannot believe the superb quality of the trinitron image after all these years
think a new flat panel tv will still be going after  years of hard usethis is one of the finest nineinch tvs from sony
all sonys inch tv sets have very sharp and crisp images
sonys dynamic picture processor and automatic white balance increases picture fidelity
however the fact alone that this is a  inch set means that the electron gun has a very short distance to aim and deliver a precise image against the phosphor screen
the closer the electron gun is to the back of the tubes screen almost always guarantees a good picture
this picture is exceptionally crisp and sharp resulting in incredible fidelitythis is one of the best  tvs i have ever seen
sonys inch tv sets are incredibly sharp
the reason is the  trinitron picture tube its dynamic picture processor and automatic white balance
the picture is colorfully crisp and sharp
it makes vhs tapes and dvds look crystal clear and pinpoint precision sharpi owned the prior model which was a pretty good set but had some nagging flaws buttons often broke pushing the wrong button reset the picture to baseline which was awful
this set has flush buttons that are water resistant the picture is good every time and even the automatic when muted closedcaptioning is useful
the fm tuner is gone but it wasnt that good anywaycassette tapes are on a comeback so get yourself this awesome tape player and dont forget to buy some hammer pants and grow a mullet
they dont get any better than this complete with micphone jacks acdc power built in speaker and mic and a mechanical counter
wow
respect the books on tapewith the purchase of a new car i found that i had no way of playing my favorate cassette tapes
this works great and i use it in the house as well as on the roadi made the mistake of buying a slightly cheaper ge recorder with horrible soundthe sony is only a few dollars more and immensely better
very good sound reproduction even using only the internal micautomatic shutoff and a carrying handle are extra features which other lowprice units dont havei bought this for my wife use at school
she is a teacher and has a lot of cassette teaching tapes
she asked to research for safe and good quality device
using this sony tcm at school makes her happy
the device has nice newdays design to play old cassette tapes
it is simple stable and safei bought this unit for two reasons
 to play books on tape and  for dictation
im visually impaired so when i need to type from printed material or enter store receipts i first record myself reading and then type while the machine dictates to me
this is not the machine for playing stereo music cassettes you can but it wont sound great  its too small and is not stereo
if you just want a basic cassette recorder with big easy buttons and no extras to get in the way this is the one
in fact ive owned several of these and theyre very dependable and longlastingworks as specd
it does what it said it would do
what more can i say
thats my whole reviewi agree with all the other reviews of this item
exactly right for the price
i use it primarily to listed to books on tape that cant be gotten on cd and it does the job perfectlywhile these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape
mine paid for itself in the first  minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape
he still insisted he couldnt remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he  being the model of honesty and truth  must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke
very effective these oldfashioned recorderssince getting rid of my rarely used tape deck i needed to have something that i could use to occasionally play cassette tapes
this fits the bill perfectlyive had one of these since  its perfect
its a tape player and recorder and thats itit never jams on a good tape
its perfect at what it doesbeing an audiobook lover i use it to listen to my books around the house and it has had a lot of useunlike units that have cd players the tape is the focus not an afterthoughtalso its far superior to tape units that switch sides for you because they often switch sides at the least resistance not necessarily the end of the tapein summation this is the tape audiobook listeners friend for reliable no trouble listening for hours and hours and years to comei searched the web to find something that i could use to record the songs that i receive
i needed something quick and easy to use
i have gone through countless cdcassette players that break down within a year
plus to find one now that has a built in mic is almost impossible so i was very happy to find this producti have only had it for a few weeks but so far it has been a godsent
the minute i hear a song forming within my mind i can quickly grab the unit flip it on and im set to go
great
no more lost songs floating around the atmosphere but now they are safe on my cassette until i am ready to transfer themit is also  great to use during church meeting when you want to be able to record either the sermon or some other happening so you can reflect back on it at a later timemy granddaughter had fun recording her voice the other day and other sounds as wellthis little guy has countless uses and it is sturdy well made and very easy to use
i like it and will write another review in a year and let you know how well it held up to the often use it will definitely receivei have been using this almost daily and love it
i use rechargeable batteries and get many hours of play out of each charge
i love it because it is portable and i can easily take my audio book with me
prompt shipping as alwayswas exactly what was needed to get an older version of a sony camera to work for my daughters camera
memory was what was advertised and great price
thanksi had to  return this one as it was the wrong size for my camera
im sure its a good product though as i got one just like it of the right sizei was first peeved about having to but stuck with a predetermined sony memory stick format
but after continued use in trv trv video cams and the sony clie pda i have to say im very happy with the memory sticks flexibility
i usually hate being stuck in a specific company format but at least sony did it rightthe transfer rate in the clie is very rapid
backing up the entire contents of the clie takes literally a few seconds
the clie has a program that allows you run programs off of the memory stick
this is not the fastest operating speed but it is no worse than a zip drive diskthe size and reliability is unbeatable
compared to a san memory card that has lost its life after  year the sony memory sticks have performed flawlessly for pics data and application runsthese smaller mb sizes arent fair for the price
go for the  mb and up  just like a hard drive you think a realistic amount is adequate
but once you start shooting and using youll wish you upgraded for the bigger sticki have an old late s sony with a carbon fiber tonearm and fully automatic arm functions
this one does not have all of those features
but it tracks beautifully speed is consistent and the furnished audio technica cartridge is adequate
of course the first thing i did was change out the cartridge to a shure mxe and now it makes me remember why i liked the sound of vinyl
cds and mps are ok but with this turntable and the shure cartridge you can really tell the difference
my records are being played again and the sound is terrifici bought this product to extend my web camera and it works great
the product is as described and the price was right
easy to use
i will buy again and recommend this to everyoneim not a big fan of the exposed connector on the female end but i cant complain much on a   cable that feels pretty durableit is exactly as described
it works good  have not had any troubles with itthat such an excellent piece of equipment could be reviewed by persons that are computer challenged
these jokers should seek help before buying a product and writing negative reviews because they bought the wrong product
geezthis usb extension cable has performed beyond my expectations for over  months
there has been no noticeable at least not to me degradation in performance to my accessories digital camera webcam and jumpdrive  by using this extension cord and it means that i do not have to be fiddling behind or leaning down in front of the computer to attach and detach the equipmentit is a great buyi purchased this extension cable to allow me to sit on my couch and still use my gaming headset on my ps
it works prefect for that i have had no problems with it and do not foresee any eitheri recently bought a cheap dollar tree usb and i kept gettingusb device unrecognized message in windowsno problems with this wire
very fast and good lengththis wire is plugged into a hub which is also connected with same usb wireno problems one month laterthis is a simple extension cable that works great for things like extending a keyboard or mouse
i used it for that purpose and had no trouble
if you need a longer extension youll need and active versiontheir isnt much you can say about a cord but this one is well made and it does what it is supposed to do
i have a keyboard a yamaha mm that i wanted to attach to my computer so i can record through cubase le
i started tripping over the standard size cord so i added this belkin extension and now it is safely tucked away
sure beats having to replace the usb port in the computer from abuse
belkin makes nice stuff and this is one of those things that they make well
highly recommendedsometimes usb chords are just too short
this chord has given me room to play with
it seems to be sturdy and reliable
i would recommend iti apparently already had one and purchased another a few days ago
although the box states  mbps on the front on the back of the package it lists that it has been tested with high speed devices
also on belkins website it also states the cable is   a quick call to belkin confirmed that it is  compatiblethis same cable sells for over  at local electronics stores
not only was this an incredible buy but customer contact was professional and consistent
i will certainly purchase here again  look out fort worthi needed a new usb extension cable and all of the local options such as walmart were about 
after searching on line i found the belkin cables through amazon a very good price so i purchased  of them so that i would have some on hand for the future
basically i got  cables for about the price of one purchased locallyi needed an extension cable so i could use a usb controller with my pc
the whole idea was so i could play emulated video games from my couch rather than from my chair my computer is already connected to my television
this cable performs exactly like i need it to with no problemsneeded an extension cord to be able to more widely use my webcamit came with an unbelievably short cord
i can now take my webcam around almost my entire room without issues at allreceived item as advertied
it works very well as an extension cable should
also received the item very promptly thanksthe usb extension cable works great
i purchased four of these for my xbox  and rock band and guitar hero games i prefer the wired setup to the wireless
the cables work just as you would expect
no surprises here but any surprise would mean bad thingsyes it is  feet long and works
it extends a usb device cable so that it can reach your computer or usb hub
not much else this thing can do
i like the graythis cord is great
works well and is plenty long enough to suit my needs
no problems with this itema  foot usb extension may seem like it is too long but i find i use it all of the time
i mostly use it next to my bed connected to a wall charger to charge my ipod touch
the next available outlet is just out of reach for the supplied charging cord and the long extension allows me to route the cable out of the way so that i dont trip over it if i get up in the darkthis product was shipped very quickly and received in excellent condition
it was perfect for my purpose of connecting my pc to my tv
i highly recommend this productsince im functionally illiterate in computer tech it took a while to find the cable extension cord i needed to relocate my canon mf  printerwith enough length to snake around the back of a foot wide bookcase and across a desk the foot cable allowed an easy move
theres even room for relocating further from the pc
nicethe connection was easily made and performance is seamless
never a glitch or interruptionto reiterate some of the other reviewers point this is an extension cable akin to an extension cord
unlike an extension cord however length matters
be sure youve chosen the proper footage for your applicationon a final note the price is exceptional
lesser quality extension cables if you can find em at brick and mortar retailers are ridiculously overpricedthis belkin product helps efficiently utilize space in my small home office
in my nontech opinion this extension cable is just perfecti have bought multiple of these
they are great to extend a phone charger
i have them on all of my chargers
they have aged well alsoworks great
ive been able to extend my gaming laptop to a custom setup over my zero gravity chair
now i can get up and move to my desk without interuptionwhen you shop for cables and other electronic adapters all you want is for them to do what you need them to dothese cables and adapters do just that
no problems no hasslesnothing fancy here
i ordered two of these  foot usb extenders and they do exactly that extend my usb devices
awesomenothing like being able to extend a short apple cable and not lose any data transfer  highly suggest you pick one or two upused this to extend usb from keyboard to computer  works well  no problems  only need  more wordsthis product works very well
i am presently using it with my keyboard
i have no problems with it
i highly recommend this productnothing amazing to say here but the product works exactly how you would want it to
belkin is always a good brand so you cant go wrong especially at this pricemy daughter borrowed and misplaced the cable that came with my hotspot
she knows i have a egadget collection and asked if i had another i did
this one is the backup now
she loves to have and use technology but has no understanding of it
i used to do this stuff for a living so everyone comes to me
well she and the hotspot are on good standing again
and guess what
the darned original cable resurfaced a few days after the replacement was put in place
go figureexactly what it says it isit worksif youre looking for a basic  usb extension cable youve come to the right place
belkins products have always been reliable and this one is no differentthe belkin fu is a gauge  usb cable a plug to a receptacle
i use mine on an older pc that only has usb ports on the back of its tower
thanks to this cable i no longer need to climb under furniture to insert my usb memory keyif you plan to use this cable to extend a shorter cable be aware of recommended usb cable length limits
lowdensity devices eg
mice and keyboards should not exceed cable lengths of  while highdensity usb devices such as scanners and printers should be limited to a total cable length of  feet
if you plan to extend your current usb cable beyond these limits consider getting a repeating cable such as the belkin active extension usb cableperhaps the best reason to buy this usb cable from amazon is to get their hefty discount on belkin products
youll pay about a third what you would at your local electronics store
now thats a bargainno honestly it works fine
not much more to say other than its a long cordlol
so you can move to another room if you wantlolive used this for years now and its never stopped working
both ends are highquality as is the wire in betweeni am using it to increase the length of some short usb cables
for instance iphone  has too short cable to charge from wall outlet
i want my phone to lie on my table while it is charging
and this extension cable helps me with thati recently purchased an inexpensive webcam which came with a inches long usb cord
obviously whoever manufactured it intended the cord to reach from the pc monitorlcd to the back of the computer and nothing more
this was unacceptablepluckily i browsed around and found this cable which was a lifesaver
its got a female a plug on one side and a male a plug on the other effectively working as an extension cord to be plugged in the middle between your pc and one of your existing usb cables that is attached to your usb devicevery good quality cables
inexpensive price
to paraphrase jerry pournelle on the legendary byte magazine recommendednot much to say
it is a usb extension cord
i have had it for a while and used it for a few different devices and it has worked great on all of them from an iphone plugged into the wall to allowing me to relocate my printer to a more convenient areait is pretty solidly built as well with thick rubber housings on the connections and a thick cable sleevethis cable works
period
havent had it long but big surprise 
chances are whatever you pay on amazon will be a lot less than your local retaileri purchased this to extend a usb cable in order to plug the cable into a wall charger instead of the pc
very sturdy wellmade cablenot much to say
its a usb extension cord
plugs fit perfectly
will update this review if the cord ever failsi bought this to extend a printer cable
i always buy belkin because of superior quality
this cable extension works perfectly
i am very pleased and at such a great low pricei like mine it gives me just a little extra cord for my key boardreally great cable if you need to use a usb device that is a distance away from the pc
i was using this for a usb cell modem and it worked flawlessly
we are now using this cable for attaching other devices and it is working greatit is a usb extender meaning it will extend your current usb cable like an extension cord for usb cables
in that respect it performs very well
no problems to report does what i need it to doi needed this extension cable to extend a usb computer keyboard cable
the cable works great no problems
belkin is a well know name for quality cablingif it works i love it
this worksthis  cable extends a normal cable
looks good
works finebelkin makes some really good cables
ive always used them and never been disappointedas usual with belkin products this cable works great and is quality made
i got it to be able to charge my turtle beach xp headset while i am using them since the only plug i can use that wont be in the way is behind the couch on the other side of the living room
it works great keeping me in the game longer
definitely a great buy
i would recommend this cablegood cable serve it purpose
i also use it to extend the range on my lightning cable to charge my iphone i recently had to move my computer
in doing so i used this usb cable to extend the reach of my mouse
what i like most about belkin usb cables is that they dont pull apart at the joints as easily as the other less expensive onesworks well with no signal glitches
for an electronic device extensioncable thats a big deal
it carries a good strong signali use this to extend the receiver of a wireless presentation remote
works great and by a reputable company
it replaced one that i purchased online that stopped working when i dropped it out of a window accidentally
ironically the wireless receiver didnt break when it hit the floor just the usb extender  so i bought this to replace itthis usb extension is just what i was hoping it would be
i bought a usb scanner recently and i wanted it placed on top of a shelf away from my computer
this cord solved the distance problem with ease
i have noticed no change in the scanners performance since adding this extension cablethe cables work great
i like the quality and i havent had a problem with them at all
thanks for a quality and fair priced producti ordered the usb extension cable so i could use a usb headset for ps
this works perfectly with no distortion or static
very good price radio shack  inexpensive compared to cables at best buydoes exactly what it is supposed to dothese work exactly as expected
i tested data transfer speeds with and without the extension cable and there was no difference
simple plug and play
they say not go longer than  feet for low speed devices and  feet for high speed devices
for kicks i plugged two cables in for a total of  feet  foot external hard drive cable plus two  feet extensions and there was no speed difference or loss of data
if you need an extension these work perfectlynot much you can really add to such a device as an extension cable
they either work or they dont and these two doso im happy
if you need to extend your usb device then these is a great purchaseits a cable
it was cheap
why pay big prices for the gold plated extra special ones when this will do the jobi needed a long extension to properly position my wireless networking dongle and this cable fits the bill
i have found that belkin cables are of high quality at least by my standards
 ft is more than i need really but it is nice to have
be advised this is not a usb  cable and many devices require one
also this is an extension not a printer cable
some devices will not work at all or will not perform properly with a ftusb cable and belkin gives you a small list of these devices on the packaging
the amazon price is less than half what my local stores want for the same exact cable and i am happy with my purchaseworks well
i used this as part of a wokfi wifiantenna
a strainer served as a receiver dish and boosted my signal since my homes wifidoesnt completely reach my shop unassistedi use this cable in conjunction with abelkin usb  port ultra mini huband all my usb peripherals work mouse selfpowered external seagate hard drive hp printer as expected
of course you cant power devices through an extension cable and hub so i dont connect mywestern digital my passport essentialthrough itnote that the product states that using usb extension cables past a certain length may result is problems using your peripherals that arent designed to be used with very long cables so you use according to your own risks but as i said before i havent had any problemsneeded a usb extension cable for a kvm that i purchased
always had good luck with belkin products and this one didnt disappointseems to be a high quality cable
i am very satisfiedthis cable works just like it should
i use it to have an extension on my wii controllers when i play without needing any movement
that way they stay charged while i waste my life awaythe cable itself is good looks durable and works finethe only thing i dont like is the color
its kind of gray so it looks oldthis usb extension cable works as described
one end of the cable has a female usb adopter to accept a regular male usb connectornow i can plug my ipad in almost anywhere in my home
what a great find
very happy with this productwell made cable that i am using to extend my web cams distance from my cpu so i can have a wider view of the roomi have always been impressed with the quality of belkin cables and this one is no exception
it works exactly as one would expect and is nice and flexible with positive connectorsthe belkin cables are well made
ive found them consistently solid in all that ive purchased from themi bought a couple of these to extend a few things farther away from my computer to crate more space
it works as it was indented to do
i never had any problems with it just plug and play and your all set
whats more great about this product is that its cheap
i bought  of these extension cables for a total of this item is exactly what it claims to be a very long usb extension
male to female gray stylishly modern
who cares
its a cable not a car
there isnt that much to screw upalways in need for a usb extension for some reason
this cable works as describedcan now operate my trackball from a longer distancewell worth the moneyi bought two as you cannot find this length in to many storesbelkin has proven itself as a leading cable manufacturer
this extension cable is no different
please disregard negative reviews by others who say it cant connect between device and pc
this is to extend what you already have so it doesnt clutter things more
a good example is if you have an iphone with the ft charging usb cable and your pc is on the floor you can connect this extension cable on a rear usb port and extend it to the desktop poking out a little yet not adding to clutter
then you can connect your iphone usb charging cable to the female end of this extension as if it was your pc directly
works well and i highly recommend this cable to extend your usb needsits a cable what more do you need to know
its heavy enough and works good bran ive used before and will use again if the need arisesif you go to radio shack or best buy or staples you will find the same cable for  or more
the cable is the same as those more expensive one and even has easy opening package
love the cables and the priceworks great
exactly what i needed for my room
running a connection through the esata to my computer and through usb to my ps
just not at the same timei used this to extend the usb port off the back of a tv so we wouldnt have to get up anytime it was usedthis works perfect to plug our external hard drive into out hdtv so the hard drive isnt hanging from the back of the tv
we watch  hd movies through it every weekend
and the price is excellent too
way cheaper than the cable i found in the electronic stores
highly recommendi like to set my printers on separate tables and not take up my desk space on hardware that is better left working across the room
great product great pricewhat else can i say
it works and its worth the money
i trust belkin they make great productsvery nice
this allows me to comfortably use my computer  while on my  inch bravia from the comfort of my couch
it has been stepped on run over chewed and generally mistreated and still works great
i bought them two years agoi needed to add a few feet to my webcam to place it on my flat panel
as always belkin did the job with no visible loss of qualityworks great nice to have the printer away from the pc on the desk
gives me more room on my deskworks as advertisedand its belkinso you know you are in good tangles
ok i made that upgood tangles
hahabut seriouslygreat cablesthis is a great cable  i  needed something long and had a price concern when i received in the mail i realized  this is a decent quality cable
thanksit is exactly what i wanted the delivery was perfectly on time and it was very easy to install it
i will definitely recommend this product
thank yougreat design the cable seems like it will last a long timethe cable i received is a shiny blue colori recommend iti just recieved this cable and it works great
like one of the other reviewers i needed it to extend the usb hub for playing rock band on my xbox
this cable works great and now there is no risk of people yanking the cord out of the console while rocking out
i havent tried it with any pc accessories but as far as i can tell it maintains a solid connection without any issuesfor a price of less than  and a brand name like belkin you really cant go wrong with this cable if you are looking for a usb extension
highly recommendedi use this for my hauppauge hd pvr
the usb cord on that is only ft long and my pc is far away
i got this and it worked just like it shouldwho says you need a name brandalso the picture is a gray usb extender
i got a black usb extender
which i actually like more
keep that in mindmany dont know that their usb devices can actually reside some distance away from their computers because theyve become used to the limitations placed upon them by the cords that come with their peripherals
but this cable makes it possible to achieve a balance between functionality and aesthetics
with this belkin component you can now think of setting up an entire room as an information hub rather than just huddling your computer station into a cramped corner
for those who have multiple platforms in one area this extension cord will make it possible to more easily share usb devices without having to buy an additional usb switcher
just plug and unplug your devices at will with the additional lengthif theres anything negative to say about the product its that you dont have much choice as to manufacturer
in a real sense that doesnt matter  youre going to be happy with what belkin has on offer
but it would be at least psychologically comforting to have more of a choicegood product for a good price
would recommend to anyone who needs an usd extension cable
sure beats the price of the local electronics storesjust what i needed at the time i m not sure its going to handle  couputers i ll know soon thanks for your help
ralphi bought two of these one for a usb power extension for my turtle beach headset and another for a data cable
both of these work well
i pulled them out of the box and thought oh man these look stiff but no they are nice a and supple wile still feeling heavy dutyi used to be a professional photographer tv news videographer and news producer so i was weaned on high quality broadcast quality tv pictures from expensive pro equipment
they are sharp with excellent color and low noise
consumer camcorders even digital ones left me cold
they just didnt cut it compared to the pro gear i had used
that is until i saw the sony trvthis baby is really a sleeper
the picture quality from this  chip camera is professional quality
the picture is very sharp digital artifacts are not noticeable and the picture is amazingly noise free even in marginal light
in low lightits noisy like all ccd cameras
manual controls on almost everything let you tweak the picture as you learn moreit doesnt look quotproquot so it might not impress your friends until they see the results
and the sound quality is not quite up to the picture quality at least with the built in mics
but if you want to really do some fine quality videography which could be shown anywhere even on network tv this is your best choicei find myself using the dcrtrv as a digital camera almost as a matter of course
i purchased the sony mb memory card you need to also buy the pcmcia attachment that it fits in and taking pictures is a veritable joy
the supplied floppy drive is next to useless  in fact i dont know how youd use it in an active environment
there are manual options aperture setting depth of field and shutter speed great for darker environmentsamong them
you can also record stills right on the tape and later extract them on your computer
transfering video and stills to a pc is effortless i use the ieee  firewire interface
to make great movies including voice over if needed and background music im happy with ulead video studio rather than the microsoft xp windows movie maker program  which appears to be a minimal implementation of uleads program
adobe premier  might still be better but im not professional enough to shell out that kind of money or so for that program
by the way ulead also allows you to create ntsc vcd files which once downloaded to a regular cdrom i use easy cd creator platinum can be played on your dvd player not all of them but certainly those produced in the last  years
anyway a great camcorder and camera i find myself walking around with it for hours on end  it just feels goodi decided to get this camcorder for the better picture ccd and slew of excellent features versus some cheaper models
i have not had reason to regret my choice
i do action photography and have actually been able to capture some stills off it that are quite impressive
nowhere near as colorful and crisp as my canon slr can give me but quite useable
and without the cost and time of having to take a slew of photos develop them print them and scan them in
dont be fooled by cameras that might offer more than x resolutionlarger pictures dont do you much good if they arent as good quality
these are almost as good as some digital cameras give you
in fact i will be selling my digital camera off as i dont really need it in addition to this camcorder and my regular camerathe camera is a little larger and heavier than some other digital camcorders and it does not come with a memory stick included
instead it includes a floppy disk adapter for capturing stills off your tapes
neat to have but not real useful in the field
be sure you get the pc card adapater as well as a memory stick this camera does not take them directlyi love the lcd screen it will flip completely over and lay flat against the side facing out
really nice for watching playbacks
it gives quite good sound and is nice and bright
the battery life is actually not bad at all compared to a digital camera
but still worth getting an extended battery
be careful about getting the highest life ones they are quite big and heavycontrols are pretty well placed and easy to use
i like having things like a neutral density filter turned on with a simple button push
overall the useability of this camera is very wellthought out and implemented
if you want a quality camcorder that will last you a long time this is one of the best for the price you can getexperience shows that when sony introduces a first new product in its class they make a killer product to strenghten their image
this camcorder is one of them the others are their first sacd first dvd player first walkman first digital walkman first trinitron tv etc this camcorder provides broadcast quality sharpness color saturation are first rate
i also tried other  ccd camcorders and none of them come close to the performance and construction quality of trv
the only drawback i can think of is the trv has a bit of bluish tone in the color which cant be adjusted and the brightness is one stop too bright which can be adjustedyou want it  you got it
excellent picture quality sony steadyshot that really works stillimage capture to tape or extra adapter cardmemory stick a must
 bright lcd display variable audio feedback ieee firewire  controls that are easy to reach and are learnedresponses for those  familiar with previous sony camsspecifically we use this unit for  greenscreen compositing of people environments and virtual products
the  firewire coupled with adobe premier is a godsend
simply said that is  essentially all you need plus consistent overall lighting in a  greenscreen environment
g or pc  firewire will suck it down as fast as  anything ive seenpositively get the custom aluminum case if you do a  lot of travel and want to keep your camera happy
this will keep all your  components safe and somewhat easily accessible
get a  hour battery the  np battery has plenty of gas  surprisingly the lcd does not drain the  juice too quickly
a pc transfer card for the memory stick would be nice   but you can get away with plugging the ieee and transferring from memory  card or to tapethe construction and attention to product detail is  marvelous
little rubber covers positive audio clicks all the nifty  nicknacks want you to have sony make your next car
sure there are a few  quirks  but theres few products that have such high quality and high  value as the trvthis is the second stylus ive purchased in  years
i have three teenage daughters that love taking pictures
my second daughter just turned  i bought my oldest daughter a stylus when she turned  they like the camera because of its small compact size and ease of use
it fits nicely in their purse
after comparing every camera i could find for under  the stylus had much better quality
in order to find as good a camera i had to double the price
the viewfinder alone is larger than most very clear and crisp
never had a single problem with the first stylus
the fact that the price has come down is a real plus also
i paid more for the stylus two years ago than the one bought recently
i give this little camera a  star
you will not be disappointed
its a really nice little camera
its easy to use attractive and it is not cluttered up with whistles amp bells youll never use
just point and shootseveral reviews enhance on how good camera is this so ill go to the point with some examples
ive taken photos with the object very close to the camera  inch with the spot metering mode with candle light tripod without flash asa  with impressive results
ive taken photos with the object very close to the camera  inch with to spot mering mode with flash without over exposure and impressive resultsso i would support that the short  inch focus capability is great and useful
if you want close photos of objects with a idiot proof little camera i mean without zoom tele macro as it should be this is the choice
i had met several focus problems with objects at m from the camera hope that practice would help me to improove
however some photos have excellent focus and sharpness
excellent dark sunset photos with the night scene mode with asa  and tripod
red eye reduction pre strobes are unconfortable but very effective
i prefer this than cheap zoom camerasdefinitevely i support the several comments of experts telling this is incredible considering the pricethis camera is one which has consistently received lavish praise from photo magazines such as popular photography for its ease of use and its superb zuiko lens which is comparable in quality to mm single lens reflex slr fixed focal length wide angle lenses
ive borrowed one belonging to relatives and am quite impressed with how it easy it is to use as well as the fine pictures that it produces
admittedly it is a bit small so those who are comfortable using larger point and shoot cameras or slrs will have to try to hold it steady
otherwise youll get blurry pictures
my favorite point and shoot camera is the yashica t super with its mm carl zeiss tessar f t lens but the mm zuiko lens on the stylus epic is just as contrasty and sharp
furthermore the stylus epic is at least  cheaper than the yashica t super
those who want high quality pictures from an inexpensive point and shoot camera should strongly consider buying this petite gemrecently i looked at over two dozen pointandshoot models doing some research for a friend who wanted to buy a new compact camera to replace his year old nikon
although we are really looking for a point and shoot with a short zoom capability about mmmm and so didnt pick this one since it is fixed focal length i was impressed enough with it to want to make a few commentsfirst of all none of the other two dozen models had a lens this fast at f
there were a couple that came close but youll find especially with the point and shoot zoom models that the fastest the lens will go is only f or  many of them are f or more at the low end
so if you want at least f speed this camera is about the only way to get itthere is one exception to this
you can buy a rollei qzw for ten times the price and get an f lens also
for the extra money you also get a camera that weighs in at  oz
however it has an amazing th of a second top shutter speed which ought to be fast enough to freeze an airplane propeller not just a golf swingwell the rollei is a great highend point and shoot but it doesnt fit in your shirt pocket very easily at  oz not to mention it will cost you a pile of green stufftwo other things the olympus has that the other models dont or usually dont have is there is no shutter lag
you hit the shutter button and theres no perceptible delay
the yashica t although it has great optics has this and so do many of the other point and shoots out there
the problem can be prounounced enough to affect action shots
for example you might take a picture of your child running across the living room floor only to find out that he wasnt even in the frame when the film was developedthe final thing that is nice about this camera is the weatherproof aspect
this doesnt mean waterproof however but a few drops of water wont hurt itall in all a great little camera to take with you anymorepopular photography recently called this camera possibly the best camera in the universe and i agreeit is small light it has an excellent quality lens
the lens quality is way above the average point and shoot
the lack of zoom is one of the reasons the lens can be so good
maximum lens opening of f and maximum shutter speed of  sec but no manual settingit has an intellegent flash that reduces flash intensity for closeup shots prevents overexposure
many different available modes give you great versatlity including red eye flash mode and a spot metering optioni own  of these camerasthe epic qd cg is the epic model that i bought with the quartz date imprinting which ive never used and the attractive metallic quotchampagne goldquot finish that arent in the base model but  without the quotpanoramicquot imagecropping in the more expensive dlx  modelthe f lens is sharp and bright and the camera is small enough  to carry in my pants pocket
but the feature i like best is the accurate  exposure system
the default automatic mode uses fill flash effectively
you can also force the flash off or on or combine foreground flash with  long exposure for night scenesthe flash is bright enough to reach   with iso  film and its brightness is automatically reduced to prevent  overexposure of subjects as close as 
the flash is close to the lens  so you should use the redeyereduction mode when the ambient lighting is  dim and your subjects pupils are dilated
using this mode i have never  shot a subject with red eyesif you dont absolutely need a zoom lens  this is a handy camera that takes great picturesive been shooting pictures since i was about  almost  years
ive owned several cameras my first real one being a canon ae that i bought in high school
i upgraded to the eos line in the early s and still shoot that line in film but added medium format hasselblad for portrait and wedding work part time
earlier this year i got a digital and decided that i would invest a lot of time into that medium
but i wanted a film camera that like my digital had a good lens was small and lightweight and shot quality printsi researched for several weeks all potential reviews on ps cameras
my wife has an older pentax that was alright but i had decided that the zoom lenses are often slow and not sharp enough
i debated between getting a yashica ps off ebay getting the newer zoom camera by the same maker or getting this olympus
i decided on the olympus and am glad i did though im sure the yashicas are fine camerasworking the camera is a snap
open the lens cover and shoot
i think the default setting is for fill flash but the settings button cycles around  so just use it for several rolls of film and get used to it
it does however reset to the default setting after you turn it off by closing the door on the lens which is a minor problem
theres no need to wait for the lens to pop back in since it is fixed focal length though autofocus  keep in mind the differenceyou may not believe me when i say this but this camera will take better pictures in low light situations than all cameras except slrs with the most expensive lenses
having to use the rest of a roll of film and not particularly caring about picture quality i took this camera to a recent nighttime high school football game
now football in texas is big and stadium lighting is pretty good but it is never good for anything other than expensive fast lenses and fast film rightwrong
well partially wrong
this camera armed with  yes thats   something i almost never shoot film shot nighttime moderately lighted pictures that came out great
the angle is wide so the content leaves something to be desired but this wide open apeture lens will definitely do the job when you need a fast quality lensthere is a red eye reduction feature in the flash cycle but i havent tried it
my applications for this have been mainly outdoor and the pics ive gotten are very sharp and as good as my slrs
the guy i sold my ae to won a national award with a pic he made with that camera
i recently asked him if he could do the same with this olympus
he simply asked me when i wanted to bring it overi have bought four of these little cameras
for different family members it is reliable
it takes great pictures
it has the necessary features but not so many that one is overwhelmed
it fits easily in a shirt pocket
it doesnt have a zoom but that is just one less thing to break or use up your batteries
if you want to fill the frame just get closer to your subject
it doesnt have all the whistles and bells of larger more expensive cameras but a camera you have takes better pictures than one you left behind because it was too big or so expensive that you didnt want to risk losing iti have the usual assortment of larger fully featured cameras as well as the required digital camera but i wouldnt be without one of these little beaststhis camera is simply awesome
take it from me im no stranger to digital photography
i was using my sharp digital camcorder to take digital still pictures but i was not very impressed with the results
moreover a camcorder is too bulky to haul around
so i decided to go with a smaller camera
i did a lot of research before settling on the d camera from olympusit is feature rich looks very cute and delivers pictures with a punch
it works effortlessly on my windows xp
my favorite feature is the x optical zoom digital zooms are generally useless
the lcd screen is crisp and clear although its use should be limited to preserve battery life use the lcd only to review already taken shots
do not use it for taking pictures  use the viewfinder
the video output works great
i could go on and on
its comnpatible with smartmedia which in my humble opinion is the better storage mediumoverall i am quite impressed with the d zoom
its simply a wonderful camera
i wouldnt expect less from olympus
regarding complaints about lack of a usb port for downloading just get a smartmedia card reader
a good card reader costs less than twenty dollars and simplifies your life a lot
i personally use pny smartmedia card reader but any good card reader should do
not only does a card reader download your pictures at blazingly fast speeds you also save your batteries by not using your camera to download the picturesps if you are looking to save money consider getting a refurbished camera
they come with a day manufacturers warranty and in most cases are essentially brand new cameras
i should know
i got mine refurbished bang for buck this is the best and most versatile  all around digital camera to get
i recommend that you buy  nimh batteries and a charger
the supplied alkaline batteries are just to get you started
i also  recommend a  or  mb memory card if you intend to use this camera while  disk adapter
it does come with a serial cable for pc and mac as well as a  video cable for viewing on your tvfor turning your digital photos into  real prints ive had good luck with ez prints   you use  their free software to send them your photos and your prints arrive in the  mail
this overcomes the last drawback of digital cameras
there may be  other similar services that do this so shop around for the best  picture you just took just doubleclick the screen button
this way you  wont have to close the camera to switch modesi joined the digital parade after an agonizing  months of comparison and indecision
i liked the sony mavica features especially the floppy disk method of storing images
ive used my works mavica  and loved its  simplicity and great ability to take indoor pictures without a flash
i  also loved the rechargeable smart battery which sony sells with its  product it actually tells you how much time you have remaining before a  battery change is required
it could also do short mpeg motion pictures   with sound
the big negative  its huge and weighed a ton
its  resolution wasnt sufficient eitheri finally ended up with the olympus  z because of its high resolution its available floppy adapter its many  features for the price and its compact size  its virtually identical to  my old mm model
it takes great pictures but isnt as capable in low  light conditions as the mavica the panaroma picture capability was a  feature which i never thought of using  until i saw the software demo  which was included with the camera
its like magic  it puts together a  panarama of pictures into a single composite image
truly amazingin  summary the  is a great camera albeit only slightly better than the    and doesnt include the floppy adapter as the  did
great  yes  but the price really hasnt dropped as i had hoped
finally if youre  thinking ahead youll order  or  nimh batteries and a recharger a   or  meg smart card and the floppy adapter
youve suddenly got yourself  a  camera outfit
shop around  there are cheaper places to buy  your cameraas so many others have noted this is a great camera for the money
its loaded with features seen only on more expensive digital cameras changeable iso values great low light capability a true optical zoom lens with the ability to add x digital zoom on topi could go on and on  about the prosthere are so manyhere are the cons ive picked  up so far camera does eats its four aa alkaline batteries quickly  especially if you use the lcd a lot
the fix i purchased rechargeable   mv nimh nexcells and a maha cf charger for under  online and neatly  solved this problem
not the most intuitive menu and button system
the fix reading the manual before trying to use does help
a quick guide  sheet comes with the camerakeep it handy to figure out those features  you dont use often
now i know how to use the features that are important  to me and dont have to refer to the manual any longer
manual is  confusing with three languagespage
the fix english is primarily on the  lefthand pages so look there first
dogear the content index page so its  easier to find what you are looking for later and keep the onepage  quotquick guidequot that comes with the camera handy
if you are  going to take panoramic photos only the olympus smartmedia cards  will support this feature
if you purchase lessexpensive brands like  sandisk you wont be able to take panoramas
the fix purchase olympus  smartmedia cards on auction sites or at bidding sites onlinei bought my  olympus  mb card for  under the olympus website price
slow photo  download rate
first of all i didnt find the serial port download overly  slow especially compared to other digital cameras
however since camera  has to be on during the download i recommend purchasing an ac adapter  doesnt have to be olympus brand to save on batteries
but if youre a  speed freak then the fix purchase either the usb or flashpath floppy disk  adaptereither will speed up download time considerablybottom line  for mebest camera for the money hands down
buy one for yourself and  seei am a rookie picturetaker
i never really had a use for a camera with a zoom lens
i was always content to use my very simple point and shoot
one day my pictures came out so badly from my simple camera that i decided that i need to get one with a zoom lens
i looked at many brands of cameras but i never considered the olympus
then one of my friends who knows a lot more than i do about cameras convinced me to test the olympus stylus epic
i fell instantly in love and i bought it
that choice has been the best decision i ever made
i love the small size and sleek design of this camera
i also love all the bells and whistles on it especially the timer because no one gets left out of the picture
it also takes very good photographs
i recommend this camera for anyone including camerachallenged people like myself
a great piece of equipment and the price was very reasonablea manual settings snob i was my  yearold minolta had a light leak
too late to get a repair before a trip to alaska i bought a point and  shoot
i bought this brand because olympus have glass lenses
but the  design is what really sold me the camera is quotsplashproofquot the  lens cover ingenious and the small very lightweight oval fits in your  hand like it belongs thereit has trekked with me across alaska  florida fell in a fountain in savannah been on a beach too many times to  mention and has bounced off airport restroom floors more than once
it  survived being thrown  feet into the street when my bag was grabbed and  the camera flew out of it
it has gone fishing with me and even scooted off  the face of a glacier onceand you know what
besides being more  durable than i could ever imagine it takes great picturestwo years  and  rolls of film later i have had  bad pictures
all because i was  taking low light shots without a tripod  my hand jiggled the camera
last  month we were on the beach at midnight with a full moon out
i placed the  olympus on stairs and set the timer so me tripping the shutter wouldnt  jiggle things
beautiful shot of the ocean the moon and unbeknownst to us  until the photos came back a sea turtle coming ashore behind usi  have taken the olympus places i would of never taken the expensive ok
ok and clunky and heavy minolta
the olympus fits in my pocket
it is not  an ordeal to get it out and determine the lighting put on the right lens  or even to load the filmi miss the minolta when i have a beautiful  sunset to shoot and know what it would look like with a polarizing filter  and asa  film
and when i was set up with it i could actually focus  faster than the autofocus on the olympus
but three bad shots out of 
i can stand a nanoseconds delaythe size and design of this camera make it ideal for what it is designed for
it takes great pictures in light and dark though its better at outdoor pictures and it fits easily into your pocket
it opens quickly with one hand no fumbling around with a lens cap
it focuses quickly so you can take a shot from a closed position very quicklythe only thing worth noting is that this is a point and click camera
if you want to control exposure shutter speed etc
or play with macro this is not your cameratakes great pictures
survives a drop onto the sidewalk dropped from  feat from a bench
handles rain no problemo
still takes great pictures
small size is great and its easy to use
the editor review says battery compartment is hard to open  it is unintuitive by the arrow direction it looks straight but look at the hindges and youll figure it out
the viewfinder is tiny but it works just fine
the cameras small size lets you get  extra pictures from a  exposure roll becuase you dont have to roll out the film at all to cross the camera body   it is so small that it fits in teh secondary compartment of the camera bag i bought along with itthe zoomer is cool
they say that it is x but a mm with no zoom is x so you are actually getting x zoom relative to a nonzoom mm wide angle point and shoot
this is the best bet for your money
if you want more zoom go get a professional camera but with that much money over  its time to go digitalthis is the perfect camera for me going to la and shooting at the la galaxy soccer mls playersperformance from such a small piece of equipment
since having a kid our travel baggage tripled and i couldnt afford to carry my canon elangreat one when i bought in  along with my camcoderi looked around for a small mm point amp shoot and i decided on delux edition of this one over minolta freedom zoom  amp  because of the price and reviews i read at this site
the delux edition has a more gold look to it and comes with a leather cover battery and has a panaromic mode functionsize is a big plus to this one even though the minoltas looked more appealing to me
the pictures came great as mentioned in lot of other reviews
the best are the ones i took in the night with night scene flash mode
one has to be very careful not to shake the camera when taking pictures in this modei have looked at dozens of point and shoot cameras for myself as well as friends who wanted to buy and although i dont own an olympus stylus epic there is one thing that is great about the nonzoom model that i wanted to mention because out of the two dozen or so models i compared the olympus was the only one that had an f lens
im not sure if the epic zoom  goes that low but the fixed focallength model does
so if you want a compact point and shoot camera with a relatively fast lens this is about the only way to do it unless you want to spend about a  for a rollei qzw which at  oz is a tank compared to the olympus
of course the rollei has that amazing th of second shutter speed probably enough to freeze an airplane propeller not just a golf swingbut getting back to the olympus there were a number of models that were f or f but the olympus was the only one at ffor the buck olympus gives you a better lens than any other consumer level camera
i love the shots ive taken with this camera great colour focus and sharpnessive had only good results with the stylus
it takes wonderful pics is very handy to tote around and takes quite a beating
my st stylus was a mm model and it resided on an open shelf in a boat for  years without misfiring once
my only disappointment has been the redeye reduction though contact lenses make a real challenge for any direct flash unit ive seeneven with  iso film the manual recommends iso  this camera takes very sharp indooroutdoor pictures with brilliant colors
havent tried the  film yet so im eager to try some outdoor evening pictures
however with the  film this camera still took some excellent night pictures using a tripod of downtown during christmas season
dont regret buying it one bit best investment in a long timeive had a lot of problems with other radios to obtain adequate reception in my home area
this radio was far superior and brought in all the stations clearly
i wish that the user interface was easier to use but the performance makes up for it
no regretsjust thought id stopshop by and look at what was available from sangean
i might as well say it ive had my current sangean radio dtvw for  years  thats  years of extensive use  hours a day x  days a week
while all other radios ive owned within this size range have long since givenuptheghost over  years ago this puppy just keeps on working with the same reliability as day 
amfmtv reception is quite remarkable as it always has
weather band has always been a little weak in some areas of colorado  you can pick up several different stations if you are in the right area which is pretty cool actually
i would not give up this radio for anything else out there
just one question still haunts me  will this thing ever die
i hope not but if it does ill get another sangeanthis is a great little radio
very light weight for walking and it has the tv channels in addition to the standard amfm receptioni have trouble falling asleep at night and i put on the headphones tune in to a talk radio station and drift off to sleep
the sleep timer turns it off in an houruse rechargable nimh batteries on this and save a bunchi wanted a cord reel to hang from the ceiling in my garage out of the way yet immediately accessible without having to get an extension cord unwrapping it rewrapping it etc
this one though much more expensive than the variety youll find at the local hardware store is built like it will last my lifetime and my kids too
heavy gauge metal everywhere with no corners cut
it comes packed like it was china too with heavy styrofoam all around
i found a reelcraft ceiling mount on another web site and it too is made to last
i would not hesitate to buy anything from this company as they obviously build their stuff for the commercial everydayuse market
ive used it for quite awhile now and have nothing but good things to say about italthough you may a bit more for this item it will last the rest of your life   assuming reasonable serviceuse
i used just about all the others and found the others to be oneway sales toss in garbage when breaks
frequently when new the others give some clue how they will ultimately fail as well as how they will perform
stiff coldsensitive cable increasing and inconsistent spring tension in lieu of constant tension thin bases poor dfm etc seems to plague the others
however the reelcraft works like a charm
after seeing the reelcraft in the professional arena being used dayafterday in the harshest of environments and  years later working like the day it came from the factory  i decided to bitet the bullet and spring for what will be my last power cord reel purchasei had a cheap offshore reel that died very quickly
ive had the reelcraft for some time now and you get  what you pay for
this is a strong reliable unit
mine is mounted on the ceiling of my garage
for me thats a perfect location
but it can also be easily mounted to a wall or other locationhaving worked as an electrician i can vouch for the fact that reelcraft used quality hubbell parts throughout
this unit has a very strong spring that winds up  feet of  cord effortlessly
the  wiring throughout really does make a difference
plug a good leaf blower into this unit vs a  gauge extension cord most of us have and youll feel the differencea tip  be sure that the unit is connected directly into an electrical outlet
if in order to locate the reelcraft  in your best location  you must use an extension cord be sure its made of  wiring
no reason to have a reelcraft that can do a great job if it has to suck power through a tiny extension cord strawupdate december   unit still functioning perfectly
can recommendupdate march   unit still hangs from my garage ceiling and works just fine
still recommendupdate january    unit in use for a few years now
not constant use that a mechanics service bay would see  but home use
unit holding up like newreelcraft l electric cord reel with gauge foot cordthis cord reel is designed and manufactured to be used in commercial settings such as automobile repair facilities where its used dozens of times every day year in and year out
shops cant be bothered with the frustration or breakdown of inferior cord reels every aspect of this reel is high quality heavy steel strong spring powdercoat finish large support bracket design and workmanship etc
as long as its not abused this product should last for decades
by comparison the cheap imports are mostly plastic to keep the price low  some even have plastic internal parts that wear out or fail too easily simple to pull out the cord length needed and stop on any click
when done it rewinds with ease and authority every time
you dont need to baby it for the last  to get it all on the reel  it just goes on
the large rubber cordstop can be easily moved so more or less cord hangs from the roller bracket the   cord is rubber sheathed so it stays soft and flexible even in cold weather
unlike less expensive reels that might use the smaller  gauge or even  gauge wire the  cord is more than adequate for any  volt tool or even multiple tools
topoftheline hubbell brand plug and receptacle are used the   pigtail should be long enough for most installations
the rightangle fitting that protects where the pigtail goes into the unit also keeps the cord close to the reel and out of the way
if the combined draw via this cord will be greater than  amps the pigtail needs to be plugged into a  receptacle thats on a  amp circuit this is the smallest commercial cordreel of this length
the reel itself is only  in diameter and the unit projects a mere  from the wall the roller bracket can be reattached in any of  locations around the reel for mounting on a wall ceiling bench or wherever you want so dont worry if the amazon photo has it in the wrong place for your installation
for example refer to customer images for a different mounting location than amazons photo shows packing was excellent with large molded plasticwrapped foam blocks completely protecting the reel from damage
unsurprisingly there was no shipping damagethere are other commercialgrade cord reels on the market such as the coxreel but i dont see how theirs could be any better
i also own a grizzly h  cord reel which costs  as much as this one and is a terrific value
however comparing the reelcraft to that grizzly is like comparing a milwaukee drill to a ryobi drill
commercial quality versus homeowner qualitythis is a lot to pay for a cord reel but commercial grade reels are expensivehighly recommendedi use this more than any other item in the shop and have never regretted purchasing it a few years ago
it truly is bomb proofso buy once and be done with iton a side note amazon cs was excellent in shipping a replacement unit overnight after ups lost the first oneexcellent product i have used for months
the cord easily retracts
easy to hook up
great for the center of the garagesimple review for a simple product  its just a good cord reeltriple head is nice circuit breaker is nicemounting is easy and hardware is included for both ceiling and wall mountingsmooth feeding out and reeling in of cordpretty sweet piece of kit
suspends from the ceiling well the rectracting assembly works well
some people may complain that it is only  gauge but it works well for quick jobs in a workshophaving owned the sangean dt the sangean dtvx as well as the sony srfv i can readily say that i like all three pocket radios very much
all three are pll phase locked loop digitally synthesized receiversthis is how they rank in my opinion best am almost a tie between the srfv and the dtvx best fm almost a tie between the dt and the dtvx radio controls the dt and the dtvx both have a stereomonaural switch bandwidth control for detecting weaker fm stations whereas the srfv has a dxlocal rf radio frequency gain switch for fm tv and weatherband signals
personally i think that the stereomono switch is far superior to the dxlocal switch for receiving the weaker fm signals when set to mono and not to stereo
the dxlocal switch on the other hand is much better for reception in large cities when set to local and not dx so that the rf gain of the unit is lowered when trying to receive very strong local signals on nearly the same frequency that strongly interfere with each other
thus depending on where you live work or play will ultimately determine which specific radio with which type of switch control you may want to purchaseall three have lockhold switches for keeping the settings fixed except for the analog volume control switch
in addition the lock switch on the dt must be set to on when changing the batteries you have up to  minutes which should be more than adequate so that the presets wont be lost
the sangean radios both have fine sounding deep bass boost switches whereas the sony does not it appears however that on the sony a small amount of deep bass boost is always on and cannot be turned off
also the sony is always in stereo mode for fm reception and sounds fine as well
all three radios sound the best with better earphones or earbuds than are supplied with the units which is not too surprising but i found the sony headphones adequate for most purposes
also all three receivers can achieve quite strong volume output levels before significant distortion occurs all three radios are very well constructed with the sony probably the most rugged design
the dtvx as well as the sony have a hinged battery door the sonys door can be forced to come off however and also seems well built but a few people have talked about the dtvx breaking if it was dropped
the dt does not have a hinged battery compartment at all but it also seems to be well built
the dt comes with a small tightly fitting slip case with a belt clip attached to the case in addition the specially designed case was constructed so that the radio can be completely operated very efficiently without ever taking it out of the case at all except of course for changing the batteries
the sony mrfv and the dtvx both have a removable belt clip that attaches to the radios and neither of them come with a case
both the srfv and the dt fit very nicely however in the zippered micro hard shell case hs by sakar available online or also available at many stores nationwide
this hard shell case is not very expensive but also provides a great deal of protection against breakage if the units were dropped presetsdt  total  on fm  on am and  random priority settings
except for its  priority settings that require a single key press it is a little harder  key presses one with a time delay instead of one on the sony to directly and quickly choose a loaded preset
however an automatic scanseek capability aps automatic scanning for and loading presets and seeking sufficiently strong stations can be used to either load presets for the first time or even scanning for previously chosen presetsdtvx  total on any band in any order called my favorites but they are found only in a forward progression without the ability to go in reverse
an aps procedure can also be used to setup presets on any band quickly and automaticallysrfv  total  on fm and  on fm  on am  on tv and  on weatherband
it is extremely simple to setup presets and to retrieve them but tuning is not an automatic procedure and requires single adjustments or the tunning button can of course be held down to speed up the scanning process powerdt  aaa up to  hrs on fm and  hrs on amdtvx  aa up to    hrssrfv  aaa  on tv or weatherband up to  on fm and  on am the dt now under  at amazon plus shipping but is now as much as  elsewhere and the dtvx now under just  on amazon including shipping are much higher priced than the sony now under  plus shipping on amazon and have only  day warranties whereas the sony has a limited one year warranty best overall i live in a rural area in the high mountains of new mexico so for my location the stereomono switch is superior for improving the weaker fm signals see my note on this above
thus for my location and for working around computers and in heavy rf radio frequency noise environments such as fluorescent lighting electric motors etc
either indoors or outdoors i really like the dt the best for the great stability of the fm signals and its ability to detect weaker fm signals it does not have a clock but it does have a  minute automatic shutoff timer
i like the sony srfv the best outdoors and it is also mostly ok indoors which comes with a clock but no automatic shutoff
for all around use if you require a small speaker as well as earphone listening probably the dtvx is the best with both a clock and an automatic shutoff but all sangean pocket radios mute during automatic scanning and seeking which makes it much harder to find weaker stations on am or fm very easily except using a manual and thus a more tedious search procedurefor more details please also see my separate reviews of the dtvx and the srfvgreat  reception bass boostgood  sound quality priority station key button layout casebelt clipneeds improvement  could be smalleri think  for a radio is a reasonable price
i was really looking for an audiophile radio for a higher price but could not find one
i had an aiwa crld for a decade but lost it
very small great soundthe sangean dt arrived on time with earphones case with belt clip and manual
you can autoset station memory for am and fm seperately
it is easy to set and even swap stations in memory
you can assign three stations to the priority button and access them quicklyim buying a radio not earphones
to test i used klipsch image x earphones
the radio sounds great for the price range
the bass boost is intelligently designed similar to the super linear bass on the aiwa
it is not designed for dirt cheap earphones which is a good thingi easily pick up powerful fm stations from  miles away
the am reception is such that i do not have to turn the radio to tune local am stations
there is no hiss on local stations and near hiss free on stations at a medium rangethe buttons are designed ergonomically so that you can distinguish them by touch
the hold switch stops everything but the analog volume wheel
the position of the wheel prevents unwanted changes
the hold switch also serves to preserve memory on battery changes
digital volume control is annoying when the steps in volume change are too large
the analog wheel is an intelligent choicei use rayovac ic  minute rechargeable batteries available on amazon
they actually do recharge in  minutes with the rayovac charger
i have not had to recharge them after using the radio daily for a week
the batteries are about two years oldthis radio is a little larger than i am accustomed to
i havent cracked it open
it may be the am antenna
the aiwa was smaller but did not have near the reception this radio offers
the belt clip is a good compromisefor the price i am very pleased with the radio and recommend it
i will continue looking for a smaller radio with high fidelity soundi have a radio shack branded version of this unit same design works fine good sound memory works as supposed to reception seems solid recommendi got this and a refurb
sony walkman to serve as wireless stereo headsets for my home theaterthis is a very nice radioi have seen it offered for as much as seventy dollars in other places on the webi am so very glad this radio was available for me to order
i have several sangean radios and every one of themlets see i believe it is  different models before this one  of one model and  of another plus one each of every one is acesim sure there are some sangeans that would not be a good fit for me but so far i havent bought one that wasnt
i read the specifications and the reviews very closely and a lot of times
before deciding to order onethis radio like the  different models i got before it came well packed
the instructions are great
the features are excellent
it is well made sounds just like i need for it to sound has the functions i need is a great size and shapeits just greati only got this today got it working in just a few minutes and im looking forward to having it for a long time
i walk dont run and will be very careful not to drop it
i have it in the case it comes in and that fits fine in my pocketa home run sangeanthis durable amazing practical greatsounding radio has been with me nonstop for several months now tagging along with me in my shirt pocket coat pocket jacket pocket pants pocket strapped to my belt tied to my sleeve dangling into a bag clutched in my hand or just laying near meive worn out a dozen pairs of headphones along the way in case you think im supercareful or anything but the radio is totally unscathed
its the greatest
it fits in my pocket has amazing sound quality and is every bit as good as it was on the day i bought itbuuuuuuuuutits amazing how such a magnificent piece of electronic engineering can be rendered so userunfriendly by poor interface designi like the small size and excellent sound quality but a few aspects of the ergonomics could be improvedfor example i like to switch rapidly between preset stations as soon as a noisy commercial comes on for example
this requires pressing two buttons instead of one  as all of my previous elcheapo walkmen could do easily  so im a bit annoyed at that
the workaround is to use the priority settings but its limited to only yet i could live with that if only it functioned properly
i bought one and had to exchange it because the lowbattery indicator didnt work
they sent me a new one and it had the same problem
guess it must be a design flaw
so i simply have to accept the fact that itll suddenly stop working without any warning whenever the batteries run outbut i thought no way that cant be true so i contacted sangean
they told me that the battery indicator light is only there to let you know that youve just removed the batteries duh
and should replace them soon before the station settings disappear
hey tell me something i dont know like the fact that the existing batteries are weak
when i told the sangean guy that every single battery indicator in every single product i have ever owned was there to tell me that its time to replace the batteries and not a reminder that i just did so a second ago he shrugged as if i were nutssecond i figured out that they must have made the left earpiece chord shorter so that you could easily tell them apart while running without having to read the fine print however they dont do anything to let you increase the slack on the chords by sliding the wires apart so the left side keeps popping out of my ear whenever i turn my head
the workaround of course is to go out and buy a dollar pair of headphones and use that insteadwhen i asked him if sangean intended to address any of these problems in the next model he said no but well be making it in lots of choices of colors
ah so good to see that they have their priorities sorted out
ahemguess ill keep this because im not finding anything better out there and frankly it does sound greataaaaghand yet i still give it  stars so you can imagine how happy i am with its qualities
sighi have bought two of these radios and worn them out
now i have bought a third dt and i see this model has been discontinuedmy first dt  was bought from ccrane
i used this radio until i accidentally killed the radio by dropping itmy second dt lasted for years and was damaged when i shipped my belongings cross country to washington
so i bought the sony walkman srfmvthe sony had presets and similar size
the sony also has weather and tv audiothe sound quality of the sony was always a disappointmentthe band button is a real problemthe sony eats aaa batteriesthe sony has no  minute off switch to save batteriesthe sony has no lock switch that prevents the assorted buttons from doing their thing
the  band button is on the front of the radioi primarily listen via a pillow speaker and some times i accidentally hit the stupid band button and my station is gone until i turn the lights back on and find out which band i have wandered intothe sangean  had awesome sound quality
almost as good as cd on strong stations
i would recommend that you toss the ear buds that comes with the radio ang get marshmallow or skull candy headphones and the sound quality will surpass your ecpectationsin closing bye bye sony
im going back to sangeanthe shortwave radio is great
very light weight and the main reason is for times in hurricanes when electrical companies shuts down the power
i also purchased some eneloop aa rechargeable batteries to use with this shortwave radiovery good for listening to other stations globally
highly recommended for everyone at homeindividuals camping and all others involved in some form of technology with radiosif your like me and you cant stand the deluge of commercials on topclassic rock radio and live on local college radio stationsthis radio is for you
all my favorite college radio stations come in crystal  cleareverything from  wfdu to  wfmu and one of the long island  radio wlir stations my big digital receiver cant even findthe  buttons are a little smallbut that drawback out weighs the features
like  a button located on the top of the radio that illuminates the lcd screen  for  secondthe short wave is somwhat alrighti am told that the big city  with all its electronics interfears with sw receptionthis radio is the best of its type for the money
the sangean  gives you ssb and a nice finetuning knob but it is considerably more expensive and also quite a big larger
if all you want is a good small amfm basic shortwave radio with a speaker and memory you cant beat thisi find its reception to be quite good on all  bandsas far as battery use it works very smoothly with rechargables
it has a segment battery indicator that displays when you first turn it on
when only  segment is lit it means you are getting toward the end maybe about  hour left
at that point you can charge a second set of batteries and install them when it finally diesyou can also just disregard the battery indicator and wait for it to die and then charge the second set
as soon as the battery power gets too low the radio shuts off but still retains the time and memory station settings
it can run in this lowpower mode for hours
in my case i had  nicads in it that died and it took me  hours to charge  nimhs that i use as the nd set
the radios time and memory settings were still intact when i finally installed the nimhs you have  minutes to make the actual switch
very nicei had this radio from radio shack for some  years and it always was one nice easy to use reliable with nice reception nice alarm human system devicei gave it to my dad and he still using it daily
the only thing is the price
it is hard to swallow an idea of  for a radio
but the device itself it superbowned one of these for about  years and dropped it several weeks ago
replaced it with another one last week
works great on all bands ssb and synchronus detection would be a nice addition thoughive been listening to shortwave or world band as its called now for about  years and am awash in multiband radios
after some friends decided that there was room for just one more i received the sangean ap as a gift and have been thanking them ever since
like everything else the sangean has its good and bad points
its compact size is just right for the pocket on the motorcycle jacket
the audio quality although nonadjustable is very easy to listen to for extended periods of time and greatly improves with a pair of stereo headphones
the fm
band displays excellent stereo characteristics and the sensitivity means capturing stations  miles away is a common occurence
the mediumwave am band is a little above average with great daytime reception and nighttime listening being almost too good  dozens of stations all coming in at once
detuning the frequency by  khz can usually help
i was blown away by the shortwave performance on a radio this size and using the power adapter over the batteries the performance increases greatly
the major stations sound like they are broadcasting from up the street and sometimes i have to lower the antenna or toggle the localdx switch to avoid overloading
smaller stations can be called up quite well and tuning up or down by  khz can help to remove some interference from nearby signals
a widenarrow setting would be a great addition as would ssb for grabbing some utility frequencies but the plusses like low power consumption with a  step battery indicator lighted display dozens of easytouse presets clocks travel lock  tuning and a nice travel case make this a great radio for globetrotting or having the world on your nightstand
i highly recommend this radio to anyone wanting to fish into the fray of world band radio and come up with an excellent catchi have owned this particular model of sangean as well as several others for a number of years
sangean radios in my experience have excellent sound for their size have great reception and are quite easy to usei listen to classical music international news and domestic news while at my home in radiotvcellphone nomans land
only the sangeans work up here
our pretty little grundig porsche radio has to live at the city house to be usefulback to the   the metal and plastic case of the  is quite solid handsome and compact
the builtin stand is both very convenient and angles the radio perfectly for easy viewing of the lcd at countertabledesk heightthe sound quality is terrific considering it is a single driver of maybe quot
sound is full dynamic lively remarkably rich and very fast
bass is lacking as you would expect over a radio with such a small driverthe  has one nasty habit which is that if you plug it in and it has batteries in it it will drain the batteries instead of using the wall power
you must take the batteries out of it before it will use the ac
mine is a fairly early one it uses the european power adapter with a us adapter on it so this may have been fixedas mantioned this is my th or so sangean and the whole line is well built except perhaps the  and they all sound great
i highly recommend them allafter trying a few different radios including the grundig yacht boy pe this one is still the best
fm reception is unequaled by any other radio i have plus very good am and sw sensitivity
many more features than the yb
very decent sound from the speaker and superb sound from a good pair of headphones
the yacht boy might sound a little better the speaker is at least twice the size but i still love playing with this little gemthere are characteristics about all radios that each individual would like to have in their ideal radio and you can read a few of those in the other reviews
however i personally cant think of anything i wish were different about this radio other than i wouldnt take it to the beach and expose it to the salt air
otherwise it goes everywhere
its also the radio i use most often in the house
and for the price you can get it for its more than worth iti guess instead of just repeating a lot of what has already been written ill just say ive bought threei am a radio nut
i even have one in the shower
i needed a radio to replace my sony sw
i live in the california central valley between fresno and bakersfield the radio reception here is horrible and i like to go to sleep with the radio on and ear plugs in
with my sony i could get fair amfm and sw with the sangean i get great amfm and sw i get stations on the sangean that were nothing but static on the sony
its a little bigger than my sony but has some great features the sony didnt
like setting the length of time before it turns off and the auto station select i used it for fm i like all kinds of musicthe handy display light that turns off after  seconds
and to pull in those weak stations a simple button to change to the fine tune mode
also handy is the lock button that locks the front pannel it keeps me from changing the station by bumping the buttons while falling asleep if you dont mind a big radio and want one for am get a cc radio
if you want a small radio to travel with or a small radio for your night stand this is the best for the pricepros great reception easy to use small comes with a nice leather case ear plugs external antenna and ac adaptercons no wrist strapi have been a radio buff and collector for many years and i have a large collection of radios
dollar for dollar pound for pound this is one of the best buys out there 
it is compact and great for travel or listening in bed 
it has and excellent tuner on all bands 
it has a suprisingly excellent sound from the built in speaker 
it has full sw coverage with a kh tuning increment which is essential for serious dxers 
it is functionally laid out well 
really couldnt ask for more in a light weight compact multiband 
it far out performs the sony sw and  and the grundig yb and  which is in the same price range 
also  radio shack carried this radio under their name  rs dx  and has recently held clearance sales where this little gem was selling at a great discount 
if you see it buy it  its a must doits got everything i needed in a compact battery powered radioas others have noted the tuning floats a little over time but the sw and am and fm bands work fine
good for the garage or working in the yardthis little radio has superb sensitivity on all bands
you will be impressed by the high fidelity output from the internal speaker
there are  sw bands and an additional  for amfm so theres plenty of content
overall the radio feels solid antenna and knobs are good quality
it is powered by  aa batteries but also will run on an a  volt adapter not included
range and performance of this sw radio rivals units costing much more
a great choice for getting into sw and its price wont set you backi have had one of these receivers in my collection for about  years
i have been worried it will stop working so i looked around for a new one to replace it found it and the price and delivery were great
radio arrived new and well packed exactly like i expected
nothing bad here this purchase is all goodi own on of these and love it so much i got my brother one for christmas
though small this radio has great reception of regular and shortwave channels without any sort of cumbersome antenna wire to deal with
the batteries last a long long time even when i fell asleep and left it on all night a couple times
just dont break the antenna off right away which i always seem to do
anyone would have fun with this
oh and its very sturdy
i actually did a human cannonball thing diving face first onto mine when holding onto the dogs leash as it saw a cat and though i got a black eye the radio was unscathed and still working greatthis radio is a good deal
it compares to my rca globetrotter that gets good am reception
the performance is better then the radioshack  whitch has synthesyzer or display noise whitch sucks not to mention that it mutes while scanning so if your blind do knot get this radio
the sangean is easy to use and if connected to a fence with wire shortwave performance gets even better
becarfull with the tuning becuss it can breakmine did so i ordered another one
grait radio sangeani bought this radio hoping that it would improve reception in an interior bathroom where i take my morning shower
i like to listen to a local news station traffic weather etc but we live in a very tough reception area near a tower that broadcasts many foreign language mostly korean and spanish i think local stations that seem to overwhelm cheap a cheap radios tuning ability
i have rarely been able to pull in our wtop washington dc local am news station but this radio does a fine job
yes it does indeed have an am band labeled as mw contrary to some reviews and does a great job
sound is quite good and the unit is small though not tiny and surpringsly heavy for its size ie
solidi first encountred this radio when sold under the radio shack brand as the dx in alamogordootero countynmwe are at the base of the sacramento mtnsin the white sands basini wanted a small radio i could take hiking in the sacramentosand this one fit the bill for sizei was amazed at how it could pull signals in the canyons of the mountains on all bandsit is remarkably durablesurviving a  foot fall and an auto wreck and kept on workingit finally gave up the ghostand i hunted for years to find anotherwell here it isanyone who wants a quality multiband reciever comparable in all ways to the grundig will find this little radio to fill the billfor the moneyyou cant beat it
asinbgf sangean sg fm  band shortwave world band radiolove this very good to have no power works on battery has different channels good to have around use it for home and traveling campingi listen to sw since i was  years old and still remembering all frequencies for some stations that no longer around this radio is very high quality solid and precise
the sw on lowhigh band is very efficient and sound is very good
as one should understand any radio is as good as radio conditions are
the time weather solar activity they all affect sw waves
if you know what you do and have a good antenna this radio outperforms anything in reachable price range
the memory banks  of them are very well organized allow banks and automatic scanning through the range and auto selection through the bank frequencies
this is one very smart radio
i purchased mine in  and still no other radio can challenge this brick despite near  years have passed sincefirst let me say that it is certainly not deaf at all on the extremely long whip as stated in many other reviews but it is certainly better with either a passive as supplied with the radio or an active antenna attached such as the kaito ka or kaito ka
now on sale at amazon for only   it is an excellent bargain including shipping
i have only had my unit for two weeks but overall i find it to be an excellent and very intuitive and much better sounding radio than the famous sony icfswgr which i have also used for over a year and i find the reception comparable but the sangean is much more intuitive and user friendly to operate even without the touted sony synchronous detection circuitthe ability to be able to quickly change bands from lw to mw am to sw and to fm etc
and in any order for example on the sangean is an excellent feature set unlike the sony icfswgr where during automatic band scanning you will get stuck in a single band until the choice of am this includes lw mw and sw all in a single choice for further details please see my separate review of that sony radio on amazon or fm is selected or unless a digital frequency is separated enteredupdate january  this radio system is really fabulous and easily worth double the cost of a new sony icfswgr for example
it certainly works better on a passive or active antenna system or on the included acdc adaptor as well but it does work great even on the whip in my subjective opinion
the ability with the simple and very straightforward and easy to operate page system to be able to quickly pull out prerecorded station frequencies from numerous countries all over the world is a fabulous and very well implimented idea
once all the numerous bells and whistles are understood by a beginner they could more easily enjoy this approach on this radio as well as on simpler introductory models as well such as on the ats or ats
they have even included the usblsb upper or lower sideband designators and ssb singleside band in the prerecorded frequenices in the numerous list of available stations
furthermore the system knows automatically and loads this detailed information in the detection algorithm as well
anyway even without synchronous detection as on the sony i am definitely hooked on this new atsap sangean
try it you will like it too
it is great fun to use and enjoy
thanks very much  for helping me decide on this particular one steve
what a birthday gift
i have only three very small criticisms so far and i will update this review as i continue to regularly use see above the ats on all of the available bands the sangean really needs a carrying handle to be installed either on the unit itself there is not even a carrying strap or one at least on the fine case that is provided
a friend of mine has one that he really loves and takes everywhere but it is now held together with duct tape and still works perfectly even after being repeatedly dropped if the unit gets totally reset for some reason i have only read about this problem the unit will reverts to the asian list of internal preset stations and has to be sent back to the sangean factory to be reprogrammed
this process should be certainly be available instead using the computer link on the bottom of the sangean as a software download on the internet just like upgrading a computer or pda cell phone bios or other such system the switches on the right hand side of the ats unit are a little too small for easy and efficient operation of the radio
fortunately the ssb single sideband switch is directly on the front of the unit and is very easy to control once the main tuning knob is put into the slow mode so that the bfo beat frequency oscillator can be readily adjusted to the position of zero beats ie so that the voice transmissions sound pun intended completely normalis the sangean atsw the same as the sangean atsx
specifications on the sangean website indicate there are some similarities
personally i can only attest to the features and functionality of the formeras the owner of a sangean atsw which was purchased in late  with the wide w fm band  to  mhz i suspect they are pretty much the same
both dual conversion pll models share the same frequency range the same clockdual time the same narrowwide filters the same audio switches  the same output jacks the same usblsb in  hz the same eeprom memory backup the same way tuning capability the same digit alphanumeric tagging of stations and the same rds readings for the fm bandaside from the attractive and updated design the sangean atsx features  memories as opposed to  on the atsw
power can now accommodate rechargeable nicd batteries which is a major improvement compared to the sangean atsw
audio is boosted from  mw to  w when ac power is applied much like my old grundig yacht boy  an individual headphone amplifier is now featured
it has a  longer whip antenna i suppose to address the poor reception the atsw reportedly had off its whip
weight and physical dimensions are  more or less the sameperformance
i would venture a guess and say they are probably about the same considering they share pretty much the same processor and some internal configuration
my own experience with the sangean atsw is excellent
i find the ability to hear weak stations amidst the static on the shortwave bands is slightly better than my grundig satellit  radiotecsun s and grundig satellit  but only when using the headphones
i hasten to add its lower floor noise is only better on certain frequencies on some frequencies the grundig satellit tecsun s and grundig satellit  either equalled or outperformed it when utilising the same external antenna
i would say the sangean atsw has better filtering than the grundig satellit tecsun s when eliminating stronger adjacent stations
but then the grundig satellit  blows away both due to its synchronous demodulatoras far as actual performance from my location in malaysia the sangean atsw matches the grundig tecsun s in receiving shortwave stations in tunisia morocco libya egypt israel chad darfur south sudan zimbabwe swaziland south africa eritrea ethiopia bahrain oman kuwait saudi arabia iran turkey greece macedonia northern greece brazil cuba usa wwvh in hawaii wewn in alabama and wwcr in tennessee knls in alaska canada ireland uk sweden spain portugal france ascension island family radio relay station holland germany vatican austria poland moldova serbia czech republic slovakia bulgaria albania romania russia afghanistan kurdistan northern iraq pakistan sri lanka india tibet china taiwan mongolia north korea south korea japan myanmar bangladesh thailand vietnam indonesia philippines solomon islands guam pulau australia new zealand and sarawak malaysiatwo negative issues often highlighted about the sangean atsw is the high battery consumption and deafness off the whip antenna
this definitely is the case with my radio
i generally use rechargeable batteries or ac power
the whip antenna is never used
instead i have it hooked to an external  wave antenna which is linked to about  meters of  ohm coaxial cable and fed through an mfj antenna tuner
the sangean atsx obviously addresses these issues with rechargeable batteries and a longer whip
and from the reviews ive read a few owners of both radios have noticed an improvementoverall i am very much impressed with the sangean atsw
i use it regularly in my shortwave dxing and find it has been more than adequate when the other radios just couldnt handle the task at hand
its not a topend receiver but for its price it is a powerful portable radioi had this model up until two years when my wife got mad at me one time and threw it across the room about  ft
needless to say the radio assumed room temperature  it gave up the ghost
however it is definately solidly built and is absolutely loaded with almost every feature a shortwave listener would want even ssb single sideband reception by using a built in bfo beat frequency oscillator switch for upper and lower sideband
rf gain switch  is handy when youre close to an am station
with headphones you can listen to stereo fm
get this radio if you are serious about shortwave and get the portable roll up antenna for really improving sw reception
this radio has my very highest recommendatiion
oh i am getting a new one sometime soon to replace the one that went airborne for about a secondi was a little nervous about spending  on a portable receiver
after having and using the ats for a full week i am  happy with it
my other quality receiver is a grundig satellit  that i had bought refurbished two years ago
the ats has much better sensitivity than my grundig with a  foot long wire antenna at  mhz where i just compared themthe grundig is better with its built in whip antenna but the ats comes in a respectable second there in my bookit also has the best sound i have ever heard from a radio this size
ssb sounds better than some ham rigs i have listened tomine came with an ac adapter and  foot windup long wire antenna
i use nimh  mha rechargable batteries so the adapter is not necessary for meexcellent portable swamfm receiver i am happykenthis is the exact same radio when it comes to reception as the sangean ats  it just has more bells and whistlesi spent much time researching various makes and models of sw radios before making purchase of the sangean ats
i have had andor currently own several radios ranging from portable sonys to very low cost china export models to full blown ham radios such as the desktop yaesu  in short i rate the sangean ats stars
it is uncomplicated and very easy to use after reading the brief manual and spending some time getting to know the radio
i simply love the  memories and the alphanumeric tagging of stations
this is the primary reason i purchased the radio  i want pushbutton convenience to the stations i listen to the most  and i want to see the name of the station which you can easily createperformance wise i rate the sangean ats as follows fm  stars
i live in the sticks but even mile away fm stations come in with relative ease even with the antenna collapsed although the antenna should be extended for clearest reception
am   stars
all of the mw stations come in fine and you should have no problem hearing all of your favorite stations although there may be some noise on the weaker stations
as with all radios for sw listening you will need to steer clear of electrical noise sources such as lamp dimmers motors and other manmade sources of noise
keep in mind that there will be very limited reception when indoors
this is true with all radios
when i moved outdoors and connected the included wire antenna reception was strong on all sw bands
in fact the wire antenna outperforms the whip antenna by a slight margin it should too being feet long
the sangean preloaded memories really make listening for a particular county or station a pleasure its really cool to select which country you wish to listen to and to further select from a list of stations from that country
the tonal quality and volume are more than adequate
the overall features of the sangean ats compared with other radios are simply superb
the overall build quality is excellent
this is a fine looking radio with a big informative lcd display and great features
i have read on how this radio will quickly drain batteries so i simply keep it connected to the wall transformer  no big dealthe sangean ats  is my very favorite radio
and thats saying a lot since i have quite a few different models
the  is fairly easy to use once you carefully study the manual a few times
its by no means a simple unit  having a number of bells and whistles  but the ergonomics seem to be quite sensiblecovering the shortwave band is as easy as it possibly could be thanks to the key pad entry scanner tuning wheel and memory presets
i find this not to be the case with some popular shortwave radios such as the rpccradioswthe sensitivity and selectivity of the am and shortwave bands are very good even when only the whip antenna is used
in fact ive compared the am reception with that of the ccradio plus and found them to be nearly equal  the ccradio plus having only a slight edge
however the  aided by the kaito ka active loop antenna is a superb combination if you want the best reception
on fm i find the reception to be excellent as well
and as for the shortwave band  twentynine pages of nine presets each each page able to be titled by the user
thats more than enough memory for an amateur
the lsb and usb also perform very well and allow you to listen to truck and ham transmissionsthe tone of the speaker is quite good for a radio of this small size and probably better than many portables
some though may find it a bit flat on am and shortwave
it seems to sound best on the fm band
i find it especially nice for classical music played at a soft to moderate volume
an output on the left side of the radio allows you to run the signal through an external speaker system for even better sound qualitythe  rests on a small folding stand which pulls out from the back
as an improvement on this i would suggest using a plastic radio stand from universal radio
this addition will hold the radio at an angle thats much easier for viewing the display and will help to make the  a practical desk or bedside radio
however the numerals indicating the time of day in hour format rather than   although they are always displayed  are rather small for reading late at night
at two in the morning its difficult to focus on such tiny digits hiding in an olive green lit display
the beeper alarm is also rather soft
if youre a heavy sleeper with less than perfect eyesight this radio may not suffice for the bedsideagain ive used quite a few different radios and the  remains my favorite alongside the ccradio plus
i would rate it as an excellent allround portable the very best for sitting down late at night and running through the various bands until your wife says come to bed its late
in fact i have two two s that is not two wives  one being the super   i would highly recommend either version to any one who takes radiolistening seriously
of all the models ive used the  is the easiest and most capable and enjoyable one
and although it may not perfectly suffice as a bedside model it makes an ideal desk radio especially since its   body takes up so little spacefinally ive had my original  for since about  and it has never given me any problems
the digits in the display window work fine as well as every other function on the radio
from reading many other reviews id say the consensus is that this radio is well built and durable
yes its expensive but if radio is important to you then the  will certainly be worth the price
its a means as useful as the internet  and far more convenient  for keeping informed in these worrisome times
note on the super  after buying and liking very much the regular sangean  radio i learned of the super  model which costs an additional 
i carefully researced and considered this modified version for over a year before i finally decided to buy one
after comparing the two however i have to pass on my opinion that the super  may not be worth the inflated price
the radios sensitivity is admittedly improved though not drastically
the tone of the speaker is brighter and clearer especially on am and shortwave but its also more tinny than the original while the bass response is in no way improvedall considered this amounted to an expensive and unexpected disappointment especially considering the glowing review i had read on a certain wellrespected radio web site which originally persuaded me to buy the super model
in fact in some ways i actually like the older models tone better its warmer and better suited for music
the most outstanding improvement is in the color of the display light which is now a brilliant blue when the radio is plugged in but faint blue when running on batteries
oh yes im quite pleased with that modification
but even in these environmentally correct times i wouldnt spend  on a blasted light bulbso if youre tormenting over whether or not to spring for the super  perhaps you should at least lower your expectations
like myself you might like the older less expensive model just as well or even better
update after using the super  as a bedside radio i have to correct my opinion of the neon blue light
it may be beautiful in the daylight but its far too bright at night
at  am this lighted window will simply burst you eyeballs
and the last thing your eyes will be able to withstand in the wee hours of the morning is a focused search for the tiny digits that indicate the time nevermind the even smaller alarm symbol
in the end the algaegreen colored light that sangean originally provides is the best and easiest way to view the display at all hours
second update sangean has updated the  with the new xhello folks its vince the radioman  i have been a radio buff for many many years with a vast collection 
i love to do compares 
the sangean  is a very very good radio 
the tuner is of top quality and the overall performance is consistant with the sony  
this radios best quality is its construction and the sound quality 
it has the best built in speaker i have ever heard in a  portable  radio 
it is very durable but a bit heavy in weight 
it is loaded with extras like a line out  ext antenna jack and a really nice ssb set up 
the am and sw sections are very good 
in its class the only better radio is the sony  because of its outstanding tuner  however  the tuner in the  is very good
all in all the  is probably the best all around radio in its class due to the sound quality and the diverse functionality  extensive memory and a wonderful visual display window  
its a little expensive and as i stated before a bit heavy but a great radio this is a nice little switch
it has a rugged case rear ports and frontside link lights
it took about  seconds to replace my base hub with this device and it has been silently blinking along ever sincedoes what a ethernet switch should
nice  indicator lights
i plugged this switch into another dlink switch to add more ports in my wifes office
no crossing cables required
i recommend this switch
please note that i bought mine used for under  which is about the max i would ever pay for a  port switchi have this little switch installed under my desk to connect my pc and various peripherals external hard drive printer fax etc
has given me years of reliable serviceive been using this switch nonstop for over two years now and have never had any kind of problem
its a great little switch thats definitely worth the money
all the ports are in the back the casing has a brushed aluminum look and its fanless so its definitely possible to leave it sitting on the desk
since the switching fabric supports gbsec that means each of the five ports can carry their full mbsec mbsec each way capacity without problem
the darn thing doesnt even get warm
definitely a good buy i rate it at  stars out of one note  if i were to buy another switch today id probably go for the  version of the same switch the dlink dgsd
darn near every computer sold these days has a gigabit ethernet connection built into it
so having that switch would most likely let people take advantage of the added speed on their local networks assuming they had cat e or cat  cabling  however it wouldnt make any difference across the internet since only a rare few cable modem even connect at mbsec and i dont know of any that connect at  gbsec
but since that switch costs about twice as much as this one theres a bit of a tradeoffive been using this switch nonstop ever since i bought it years ago and it has been fully functionalhurrah
not much to report except that its as painless as technology will ever get
you plug it in and now you have more ports
successi have typically been a linksys only customer but being frustrated with some of their products lately i decided to make a switch and im glad i did
its compact design makes it easy to tuck it away
i have yet to have a problem with the  that i bought one for home and one for work
they have been running  months and counting with all the ports active in both locationsthis is a great swicth with low price
i use it together with dlink di port internet sharing router to build my home network with  pc two servers one powermac and a laptop connected to cable modem isp
connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesnt show any noticeable slowresponse as compared to connecting via the router directly
it works well by itself as we as with dlink dii just took this out of the box and had it installed in less than five minutes  seriously
i was a little surprised at first because it is only a little larger than the size of a deck of cards
so i took out the included ac adapter and plugged it into the hub and into my powerstrip
then i plugged the included usb cable into my computers usb port and into the hub
windows  recognized the new hardware and installed it with the windows  cd in about twenty seconds
then i plugged in my intellimouse optical and my intel camera and windows installed them as well and i was all set
five minutes after opening the boxso these are the great things about it
easy to install literally five minutes
great size not much larger than a deck of cards
great price pci usb ports cost twice as much
works great four devices can be plugged into the space of one of your computers usb portsa great buyi first went to local retailers to comparison shop and found competitive products generally priced two to three times as much
so i decided to give the dlink a try
i powered down my hewlett packard running windows me and installed the new hardware
i chose to use the optional ac power adapter because i was hooking up the quotviking  intelliflash smart card readerquot and wanted to ensure enough powerupon rebooting windows me automatically recognized the product and installed the required driver
i verified the installation under quotcontrol panelsystemuniversal serial bus controllersquot  it was newly listed as a quotgeneral purpose usb hubquot  i cant imagine anyone having problem adding this hub to his or her existing systemi give it a perfect  for ease of installation and excellent valuewhen the number of usb devices here exceded the number of ports on my dell dimension i shopped around for a  port usb hub
this unit looked appealing not only did it come with a  foot usb cable it could be powered by the computer usb port or from its own wall wart power supply
when it arrived it was an easy and straight forward install
plug the supplied cable into the hub plug the hub into the computers usb port plug the devices into the hub youre done
turning the computers power on five leds lit up green
one led for each port and one showing the hub is running from the computers power supply
a red led lights to show when the hubs wall wart is supplying the power
elegant simplicity in a translucent package the most difficult thing to expect in setting this up is opening the blister pack to get at iti have had this for awhile and have not had any problems
i have a camera and some other things plugged into it
it is nice not having to worry about running out of usb connectionsi bought this hub several months ago and i am extremely pleased with its performance and looks
i am very pleased with its esthetic looks due to the clear case
one nice surprise was the fact that included with the usb hub was a power cable
this allows the hub to power the devises instead of siphoning power from your computers motherboard
this helps keep your power hungry devices happy
i would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good usb hub not only for its esthetics but for also its supreme performance for such a great pricethis hub is really very easy to install
plug it and youre done
the ac adapter is included in case the devices need more power
it can be used without the adapter as well
it looks great its very small so it doesnt occupied precious space and its affordableplug it in and plug in your usb accessories and it works like a charm
no more fumbling in the back of your pc box to pull out the usb connector of an accessory you are not using to plug in one you want to use
the connections are in the front of the dlink box
good price compared to linksys belkin and other competitive models
i am quite happy i bought this hubtheres not much to say about this product
i just plugged it in and instantly forgot about it
i was a bit skeptical because most usb hubs tend to be a bit pricier but the dlink hub works great and it cant get any easier to set it up
i love the compact design as well
this one is definately a nobrainerthis hub was a great value
i was suprised how much usb hubs go for and this one represents an incredible value for someone who just wants a simple small usb hubthe hub itself is small and attractive with lots of leds to light it up and the now so popular translucent stlying
set up was a breeze plug it in and your good to gothe hub also supports selfpowered or buspowered operation
this means if like me your hooking up small low power devices to it you dont have to plug it inthe user guide is a little lacking and the retail packaging is a little plain but if you can live with that this is an exceptional valuethis is an excellent product
installation was super easy
performance is flawless
its pretty nice not having to pull my computer out of its corner and try to find usb ports in the dark
even if you dont need extra ports its nice to have them all out front remove tiny transparent device from box
 connect w good quality supplied usb cable to pc
 connect up to  usb devices to hub
 get to work
it is really that simple
it has  green status leds  for each usb port and  for power on
it also has a transformer for external power which is only needed if your usb device draws a lot of power like a usb digital camera
this is a great peripheral at a great pricesimple to hook up and use
includes an external power supply that the instructions say is optional but that should be used
the usb subsystem provides power to many of the accessories that attach to it card readers etc
if you dont use the power supply attaching more than two devices will overtax the usb system and stop all devices from working
so use the power supply immediately and youre all set
great value leds show port statusthe standard of  usb ports for computers isnt really enough i have a  pda cradle webcam intellimouse explorer scanner and a zip  drive  that all use usb ports and it gets to be a hassle having to switch them  around all the timehub works great i reccommend itthis is a terrific value
ive expanded my laptops single usb port into four  quickly and easily
even though i had read some mixed reviews my experience has been very positive so far
you really dont need to spend more money on another hub  this ones a great value reliable and is nicelooking too
i wouldnt think twice about buying this productreally like this antenna
just wish it was a bit longer like a total of  feet long
have it set up in living room near ceiling and does what it is suppose to dowow
this is a good range extender
i am new to the shortwave game but i must say this is a good antenna for my ybpe
i am hearing stations i didnt think id be able to get
i am new to the whole shortwave genre but this is good
it is very easy to use and it does add to your antennas normal rangefor a reasonably priced antenna this is a great product
use with a mulitband radio that gets carried outside frequently
compact size and long antenna make this unit very adaptable
i velcrod the case to the back of the radio for easy carrying
pull the antenna out as far as necessary to get a signal
i found the antenna wire to be quite long and durablethis little antenna really makes a huge difference
it brings in the weak signals so i can hear what is broadcast  while listening i have disconnected and reconnected it to compare reception with using just the stock telescopic antenna and it makes a world of difference
i use it indoors on my tecsun pl but i have tried it outside and it does work even better outside
it may not be a super antenna but it really does a great job for improving reception and the price is great tooi bought this for emergencies and have not tried it out yet
it is for my bug out kit and hope i do not have to use it for that scenariothe shipping was fast and the description was correcti would recommend to anyonevery nice antenna easy to use and the fact that it was compact made it easy to use and to storeeasy to use and put away
i kept the one that came with the radio with the radio
i put this one up permanently at home for quick useis exactly what it is described as
a  ft portable antenna
easily pulls out of the case and and you have a long wire antenna
attach to your radio using the millimeter mini plug or clip it on to the radios external antenna
winds back in with no problem
very good deal for the pricegood alternative for a portable antenna or if you cannot have an outside antenna
works surprisingly well
can give you more noise when used inside but still better than using the whip alonethis antenna comes with the atsx radio
you do not need to order it unless you lose the antenna included in the box
this improves the reception dramatically on sw  it doesnt improve standard commercial am reception very much except at night
the atsx radio comes with this antenna and the carrying case for the radio itself
the antenna itself is outstanding for its size
very compact rolls out and in very easily just use the shuttle style knob to reel it back in
it does improve the received signal considerably compared to the ship antenna
it does plug directly into the atsx antenna jackthis antenna is excellent
i placed it on my rooftop and i was able to pull in signals from all over the world
it is worth the price to buy it
by gregg l friedman md psychiatrist hallandale beach fli coundnt believe is was so reasonably priced 
i have wanted one of them for a very long timethis is a great antenna that makes a huge difference in reception just attach it to the inout plug and watch it worki used this antenna in the house this winter and it worked out well on my tecsun  sw radio
i use another type of antenna i built for summer and outdoors but this antenna could be hung out a window and hung as high as possible
they say position to the north for best reception
have to go to the web and look up sw info
to location and time of year
i  really like that it plugs into the radio and has an adapter if needed to clip onto the antennai have several wind up antennas
they all workthey are all just a convenient longwire
the added whipclip is very handy
for the price id by another one when i need itwire is a bit thin but doesnt affect the operation of the devices
the wire antenna that came with my shortwave only had a clip on which was not convenient
this one has  jack for external antenna and clearly get me better reception across all bands
probably the best overall antenna in a super portable package
recommendedthe signals improved significantly  if there are no blockage from buildings etc and if it is high the signals are excellentits a good little unit
but remember its only a portable and will just improve reception so much
i do recommend it for its quality and portabilitythis antenna will easily improve your inexpensive shortwaves reception
my old sonysony icfswg worldband radio receivershortwave picked up stations that were never possible with the builtin antennai purchased the tecsun plslv to put away in a faraday cage in case of emergency and wanted an external antenna
even though there is really no gain this antenna allows portability and the ability to have something outside away from inside walls and interference
not bad for the money
this would also be great for a portable antenna to take with you on the goit coils nicely without hanging up
comes with a coupler to clip onto other radio extending antennas
not a replacement for a homebased antenna
good for what it is a travel antennathe drive arrived quickly and answered my needs
i have it installed with another gb drive and i am happy with the performance
i am especially grateful for the good packing and quick shippingi have used both western digital green tb and seagate barracuda  tb in dlink  nas device for about a month
these are my experiences seagate didnt need firmware updatepackagingwd was packaged very well with cushion padding where as seagate was packed really lousy
i had ordered  drives in each brand and one of the seagate boxes looked like it was opened already may be it was human error while packaging i didnt bothernoiseseagate is noisier than wd but it is much smoother than wd
meaning wd produced lot of hard clicking sounds that really irritated me both drives may be just the two i received were defective
clicking sounds from seagate felt normal to me and it was muffledheatseagate got much hotter than wd
i figured wd didnt produce as much as heat because it uses intelliseek that runs the motor at optimalslower speeds rather than the advertised rpmspeedi couldnt compare speed as i was running wd in raid and seagate as standard drivesoverall i am very happy with seagate mainly because of its much smoother operation and brand reputationhope this review helpsi was weary about getting this drive since i heard all the problems of loosing data and these drives going bad after a short time
dont believe the hype
i went ahead and bought it and installed it
i went to the seagate knowledge base site downloaded the firmware and followed the instructions on the site
i updated the firmware and the drive has been running smooth and fast
i love the space for the os and all the apps i have loaded
the price is so good too that i think i am going to buy another one so i can dump all my pics and music on to it separately
or maybe two so i can run a raid setup
anyways dont let the firmware problem scare you this is a very good drivebought this when it was in the goldbox for a friend
he has  setup in a raid and it seems to be working great
they just work
seagate has never steered me wrongperhaps amazon has done some retraining of their warehouse crew since the earlier complaints were posted
my tb oem seagate barracuda was packaged very securely inside of foam padding similar to what is found in the packaging for retail seagate drivesthis box was then placed inside of a second box for shippingit only took  business days to arrive via usps
thumbs up to amazon for their care in packaging of this drive for shipmentthe disk arrived ups i installed formatted and used it in a windows home server
it came right up and continues to work fine
i somehow missed the fact that it was an oem product which means no box just shrink wrap
no cables just the drivei bought this about six months ago when the price was much higher but i still feel like i got an exceptional deal
this had ncq native command queuing that most drives do not
that means when files are highly fragmented the disk drive itself intelligently reads the files according to where they are positioned on the disk and then puts it back together before sending data to the computer
the result is a faster disk than one that doesnt have this feature
i had zero problems with this disk unlike one of the  tb drives
i had to send that one back for exchange and got one back that vibrates slightly
so i plan to purchase another  tb disk with ncq to complement the one i have
i may make it into a raid configurationi just purchased  of these drives for use with a voyager q from newer technology as my backup system
my computer is a  ghz imac and im running these drives on fwregarding performance these drives are great
as a comparison i have a gb wd mybook fw drive  that i had been using as my backup drive
i copied a gb file from the main computer to both drives at different times and it took over  times as long to transfer the files to the old drive which is less than  full compared to these drivesnonperformance stuff this drive is quiet
also both of my drives checked out to be unaffected by the drive issue according to the seagate websitethis product have been serving my need for over four years with out any problemive had wd black which is also very reliable but i went with this because its cheaperim sticking with seagate and wd onlythis drive was ordered as a replacement drive after one of these failed in my nas due to power failure actually daughter with a flat iron
i received it quickly and it installed and was up in seconds
the other drive is still going stronggreat hard disk
very quiet and fast operation
with a sata installation it is very easy to route cable around the inside of the boxwell the hd on my  yr old hp mmpc died and i decided on this model to replace it
installation was a breeze and my system was up and running in no time
so far the drive is working fine  fast and quite and much larger than my old drive
if you do not need the sata cables and controller go for this one its only the bare drive and therefore cheaper than buying the kit which includes the cables and controller
nuf saidthis unit also is an exact replacement for a second raid sytem i neededshipped on time and properly packegedmany thanks
 markthe dern thing is almost too quiet
just intalled  of them raid  i cant tell when theyre spinning
wowif you are installing in an older pc like me that doesnt support sata  you will need a jumper not included to change to sata excellent disk drive
gb
fast
easy to install
great amazon price  fast delivery
no problems
remember to buy a molex to sata power cable adapter
needed for older systems with molex  power only
converts  pin molex to sata power  pinthis drive performs without fail
i have seven of these  gb hard drives and all have been excellent
i use these formatted with a mac so i can speak only for mac performancewhen you get this drive just go to seagatecom and pop in the serial number and it will tell you if your drive needs the firmware update or not
i received mine and was told by the seagate site i did not need it
so i installed loaded os powered down a couple of times to test and everything works fine
pretty fast write speeds as well
btw i have purchased personally and for work seagate maxtor western digital and hitachiibm drives and all have at one point or another have failed
yes the seagate issue is a special case just like the ibm deathstars years ago
but to say one company makes drives that fail more than others is just bullcacai have absolutely no complains for this hd
excellent performance and for a good price recommendedi dunno what the negative reviews are for small print indicates they are not about the stas but another drive
i bought my stas over a year ago use it in an external vantec case with firewire connection
blazing speed never a problem
note that if you buy the drive alone you dont get rails disc anything but the drive itself
if you want a kit with all the cables etc then go for that and pay more
i was using western digital hds for years finally gave up after the nth one died
been using the seagate barracuda line exclusively for several years now gb gb tb
no complaints
they run so quiet you dont know theyre there
highly recommendedi use this in an external hard drive case and have owned it for over a year
it worked fine for me
i partitioned this without any issues
it has not given me any issues till date
i have it hooked to my wdtv and it works flawlesslythe speed on this is blocked to gbps by a jumper
remove the jumper to bring out its full potential of gbpswould definitely recommend iteverything fine
good shipping
nice deal
drive works fine
fairly fast
a good workhorse hard drive
i am very happy with this dealeasily installed in my generic brand windows home server
plenty of space now for shared files backups of laptops etc
i had to buy a sata cable at our local computer recycling store for  but it fired right upi took this converter to a very long european trip
it worked just fine
my family members were using it for both highwattage and lowwattage appliances
it was very handy to have a single converter for all cases
what can i say  it worked as supposed and didnt break
the set of  different adapters all types used on the planet was very handy toothis set with the case and various different converters is nice for the price
it is well made and practical for travel all over
i usually just look up which one i will need for the country i am visiting and take only thatthis converter has everything you need while traveling abroad
good fit good function good price
a real necessitywhile its a bit hefty in its box i take only the adapters ill need
weight aside the wife and i have used these adapters in europe england scotland  countries in all it has worked perfectly for two years and lots of travel
used it for everything from digital cameras to electic shavers and cell phonesive been using my recoton for over five years to power my braun electric toothbrush in europe
perhaps the only problem with the recoton is the plug
as the converter is so heavy it does not always stay attached to well to the walloutlet
i use mine in multiplug strip that sits on the floor so i dont have to worry about the converter falling out
if you plan on staying in one place for an extended period of time ie
not using the converter while traveling i would suggest the franzus  watt available on amazon
its heavier and bulkier than the recoton but its grounded and accepts us grounded plugs and uses the shhukastyle grounded and recessed holding the converter nicely in the wall plug found in much of europei bought this set primarily to be able to recharge my dvd player battery which has a vonly ac adapter rather than the v capability that many chargers for cell phones cameras and videocams as well as hair dryers and razors now have
if the device or its charger is v you only need a plug adapter to fit the electrical outletthe voltage converter worked perfectly and allowed me to recharged the dvd battery via its ac adapter power cord half a dozen times
i had the wattage switch on low w for this use
i would award four and a half stars if i could because i never used it with a high wattage appliance and hence cannot attest that it works as well under such conditionsi sometimes travel with a portable hair dryer but it has a dual voltage switch so i only use it with a plug adapter
additionally the dryer is in the neighborhood of  watts so i would be reticent to try an appliance at the top of the converters stated wattage rangethis kit is well made contains all the plug adapters youll need to travel to  continents and unlike some has switchable wattage to allow the use of both low voltage eg
battery rechargers and high voltage eg
hair dryers appliancesi fought it for someone who lives over seas
she already have one which is her neighbors  so she wanted one so i looked up the name and it came up
i read the reviews and bought it right away
it comes with many useful adapters so that it doesnt matter where you go there should be allritethis is a product i had before and it is simple to hookup and it works great with no problemsive had one of these running it on and off for  years
i bought it to connect my pentium  with an riva tnt to play the original diablo and duke nukem d
now i use it to bridge to my tv
i cant believe theyre still availableperfect for classrooms
small unobtrusive and works right out of the box
had a room of students working on computers in  minutesthis is one of three i own
i use this as a remote switch just for the ease of connection and the size of itgreat for lan parties and hasnt failed me yet
good buy for the price as well especially with how many ports you geti have used a number of netgear switches and routers over the years and find the fs to be simple rugged reliable and fast enough at a low price
i used this switch as the central distribution point for cat cable runs in lieu of a more elaborate backboard installation
the switch is wallmounted in a utility closet and easily accessible if we need to make changes
the switch is as described and was delivered on timei have a linksys  wired port wireless connection router and needed to add additional wired computers to my home network
this switch was very inexpensive compared to other choices
installation was easy  i just plugged one connection into my router and connected the remaining computers and it was good to go
i have both internal and internet access and theres no noticeable difference in speed
some reviews have said it runs hot but i havent noticed that at all
theres no warm electric smell and the box is cool to the touch
i highly recommend this unitnetgear provides an excellent durable professional network switch
and amazon offers it at an unbeatable low price
excellent
this router works fine with all of the hardware including a brother laser printer an apple imac and a windows desktop machine
this switch will give you your best bang for your buck guaranteedthis  megabit switch is great if you are starting to feel the squeeze of a  megabit network
if youre like me it getting pretty old moving huge scanned pictures and other large files around the home lan
at  megabits it typically took me  minutes to get a cdr worth of scanned images over to my cdr writing machine for backup
well not any moresince i hooked up my fs i can move a cdr worth of images or mp files  megs worth in about  minutes instead of that this switch is a piece of art
built like a tank incredibly solid and small for what it does
no fan so it makes no noise whatsoever
the switch hooked up painlessly and worked flawlessly from the getgogreat price use a lot of themi bought this to wire my entertainment room with ethernet instead of wifi as my routers signal is spotty at times
i have an imac apple tv and bluray player all hooked up ti this switch
there is no buffering when watching any streaming service on any device
highly recommend this for those with weak or spotty wifi signalswe have ordered more of these since this one and it does a fantastic job
quality product and it served the purpose that we needed it fori couldnt find an port wireless router that i liked so i reverted to using this switch
it works perfectly and since each port is autosensing you dont have to fiddle with which port is the uplink port
reasonable priced as well
you can spend half as much for chinese knockoffs but i dont want to take chances like that  all these packets need to get to the right place error freeworks as advertised
i would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable port switch for home use
this is very plug it in and gotheres really not much to itgood allaround switch for home applications
easy setup
compact size
id recommend that anyone buy these
simple way to expand your internal network especially in new constructiondoes what its supposed to do
great deal for the price
id buy another one of these if the need arisesthis switch is now located behind my entertainment center
it handles the xbox satellite blueray desktop computer and a spare wire for a laptop
it does a great job and the price including shipping was better than the local shopsan incredible product currently running on a home linux network works great and stays up and working for long even for burning cdroms through nfs great producti have been using these for a while and have had great luckpros price great lifetime warranty fast gigabit unmanaged switch solid heavy casecons non so far  i will follow up if i have any problemsseems to me when a unmanaged desktop switch works well its just what you want
this is the case here
speaking of case  this unit has a metal case which gives it a little heft
when you have a bunch of cables plugged in it has a better chance of staying in place and i think it is more durablethe switch allowed me to finish up my network within my home
takes up very little room and extremly easy to hook upespecially good for all connections using ethernet and networking becomes a real breese to install and set up with this unithigh quality for a low price
i will not hesitate to buy it again if i need a  port switchfabulous
worth every penny
i have my bluray ruko and apple tv all connected and no loss of quality
excellentreally good experience so far have had it running  for  months and has worked very well cant complainthese are the best there are sturdy simple and work every timei use mine to hardwire first floor of the house for blue rays desktop and hookup location for work laptopthroughput is great and installation was extremely simplethis design did not change for last  yearsthis device may look simple and that is because it is
you just hook it up and volia
internet to all your devices just dont forget to get a good router
when it comes to networking i am not the brightest but these were easy to figure out how to use and so far they work great
they seem very sturdy and the wall mounts make they easily accessible
we have two one connected to the pcs and one that we use to connect all our gaming devicesthis switch works like a charm
zero setup so it was an easy install
i needed multiple network connections at my entertainment center hdtv bd etc and my broadband router is in an upstairs study
wireless just doesnt do it yet for streaming movies plus i did not want to buy a wireless adapter for each device
this was a great investmentworks perfectly with our office wifi systemgreat buy and not problems at all
i highly recommend it netgear is always a good quality buyi had one ethernet internet cable coming in to my home theater but needed to hook up my directtv dvr and samsung blu ray player
worked like a charm
it has more slots than i needed but may hook the wii console to the internet some dayif i figure out why
good product and with the  rebate it was a very cheap solution to my problemmy old hub died after six years of use so i bought this to replace it
it was braindead simple to install and it works greati needed to be able to connect components in my home theater system and this was perfect for the job
yes there are a couple of these even cheaper but sometimes you do get what you pay for
this is a hefty little box for the size and it feels quite solid and well made
while i agree with a couple comments regarding the location of the power plug it was not a deal killer for me at all
it sits back behind everything and is in no way an eyesore among my tv and game gear
i have it connected to an xbox my dvr a sony bluray player and have one port still available if i ever decide to connect my tv
i ran an ethernet cable from the modemrouter in my media room into the family room via the attic and once connected all components worked immediately with no issues at all
we ended up using the extra port for a few days while we were having problems with our wireless network before the replacement router arrived and the connections on the notebooks were excellent as well
wireless module had gone out ethernet was still working fine obviously
this is an wonderful deal for the price especially with the rebateedit been meaning to mention this for awhile i liked this particular switch so much that when we needed it i bought another one of these for a different room it works just as well
both are still working flawlessly and i highly recommend this item if you are in need of an ethernet switch boxi purchased one of these to split out the cat cabling in my basement i only had one cable coming in but needed three
so far it has been working  for the past  months with no problemsthis switch is super simple
there are no web interfaces and complicated configuration steps to go through
dont need them
just plug it in plug in your cat cables and go
the hardest part of the installation was installing the screws for wall mounting itthe only thing i can complain about is the huge power supply that powers it im pretty sure it outweighs the switch and it is large enough that if you plug it into the top socket of an outlet it will block the bottom one
thankfully netgear chose to go with prongs that allow it to be inserted upside down in a socket
additionally they provided about  feet of wire to give plenty of flexibility in locating the switch and i was able to place it in an inconspicuous spotif you need expand your home network this little unit will do it in a snapswitch works without any issues              i installed one of these on each of the two desks that me and my wife have in our home
now we can plug into the network with a  cable and we are off and runninggranted a wireless switch is not the most complex of all product purchases i was more than happy with the setup
unwrap plugin to your existing network and youre in businessthe package arrives neatly packaged and properly secured
the packaging is easy to open and everything needed is included except for an ethernet cable but you should have  or  of these laying around alreadyinstallation is super easy just plug in the power connector and plug in your in and out ethernet connections and youre doneconstruction is very solid and i can see this box lasting almost forever unless you drop it from a  story buildingwhat can i say
it does what it should  its netgear
we have never had any problems with netgear products and for  who could pass this upplug it in and it works  why cant they make all computer devices this simple
no setup no muss youve already got about  of the cables you need from old devices
nothing could be betterworks like a charm no issues no concerns no problems
used the in cascades with  machines
tried it for many months nowa nice looking product in a metal case
i plugged in the cables and the power supply and it worked
end of story
what more could one want in a switch at a good priceeasy to plug in works exactly as its supposed to the price is right
dont forget to have extra cat cables around to plug into your router
better yet pick up some using amazons addon program with the low low prices and free shippingwith all the items i have to hook up online there is just not enough room on a router to hook everything upthis is where this great switch comes in to action
with a jumper wire from the router to the switch i can then add all my other data line hook ups with out loosing any power or speedwho ever thought of this is a geniusif you find your self running out of room to hook things up this is your answerinstalled this switch to serve a printer and desktop pc
its been rock solid so far
the printer would not hold a reliable wireless connections so i opted to use its ethernet portfor me this was very simple to install and set up
basically just plug it in and plug in the ethernet cables and it worked
there was no software that had to be installed and so it was about as simple as it gets for me at leasti have owned these for roughly a couple of weeks but i have never had any issues with any other netgear switches that i have bought in the pasti bought this little switch to run either my bluray player or my logitech review from one ethernet cable which runs from my router
build quality is good and it works great
i would recommend itthe reason that i purchased the device is because i ran out of ports on my router
i need two devices to share a port on the router at different times of the day
i didnt know if it would works but it works great
for  one cant go wrong
jmci do a lot of networking with other businesses linksys and belkin love the linksys and the belkin bothi am very happy with this switch it workes great without problems sofar connects easely and smoothly without troublei love this switchit says connect and use i just connected all the cables with in seconds it was working great with no problemsi recomend this to anyoneif anything goes wrong i will update
bought at staplesi am using my moms accountnice little switch box that works exactly like it should
i unboxed it mounted it on a wall plugged it in and it was good to go
better built and half the size of the d link switch it replaced
i really like the fact that it has a metal housing and not cheap plastic
if you need a well built an inexpensive switch i highly recommend this oneits tough its reliable no configuration necessarywell suited for home or industrial useive bought many of these over the years for myself and for clients ive never had one go bad and the quality has maintained itself over the years
fantastic productowned it for over a year works without flaws
simply plug in your stuff and it works
if youre looking for a ethernet switch then youve found itgood buy good product
works great for exactly what we needed
no problems so far  the reviews were goodthis ethernet switch worked exactly as planned
switches are simple pieces of equipment that should be placed as basically a way to get extra ports on your router
take a cable from one of your numbered ports on the router to the switch and you now have  new ports on your router
make sure when you do your math though you count the two spots one on the switch one on the router that you wont have
example if you are using a linksys router they have  numbered slots usually
and this has  that does not mean you can get  devices hardwired
you will get  instead of four computers on the router one cable on the router goes to the switch and then four extras on the switch
good lucki bought this switch because i wanted to go from a wireless environment to a hardwired environment
the modemrouter is in the living room and my bedroom was completely wireless xbox  and pc
due to issues with the xbox  wireless settings i decided to hardwire the xbox  after having issues with the services to my pc via wireless i decided that i too wanted to hardwire the pc
my only concern was that i did not want to run  cate cables from the router to the bedroom
i decided to run  cate cable to a switch in the bedroom and then a cate cable to each the xbox  and the pc
thus far it is working like a charmsimple and effectivenetgear products have always been my first choice in home interconnection
ive found netgear products to be reliable and full featured quite frequently having more of the needed and hand features that their competitors offerthis device was needed to expand the port availability to my curent system to allow addition fo internet linkage for a newly installed solar array system to my house
the divice works well and meets my needsworks great in my entertainment center
have a lot of devices these days that connect to the internet and decided to cut down on the wifi in the house
this guy works great with all the devices no hassle easy installperfect cheap switch when you just want to plug it in and not have to worry about configuring a device
this is not a managed switch but why pay extra unless you absolutely need management capabilities this is a perfect buy if youre looking for a unmanaged switch to just connect a couple of devices off one ethernet portseems rare for any networking device to simply work right out of the box but this one did
i bought another one i liked it so muchi purchased this unit for my home network about  years agoand it is still working great
network traffic progresses smoothlyeven at  seperate stations and has a great value for the moneycompetent switch
netgear seems to be like ciscos cousin when it comes to at least home routers where ciscos businessenterprise routersswitches are sworn by i can say the same for netgear at the home level
very good switch i have my computer  printer plugged into it far away from the router its in another room perfect throughput everything is great
printed through it from another computer on the network multiple timesthis worked flawlessly with a powerline adapter then splitting out the connection to a ps logitech revue and minimac
none of the downstream components had any issues receiving or sending data through this device
highly recommended for a cost effective solution outside of using wirelessfast shipping great great price
this netgear switch works exactly as described
integrated into my home network with ease
im using this with several apple items
my signal chain iscable modem apple extreme base station wifi netgear switch xbox  wii mac mini apple tv
all of my devices get internet and the speeds seem to have increased across the boardsmall compact size does not take up a lot of room
happy with the purchaseim using this to subdivide a network and it works perfectly
no setup just plug and play
i really like the netgear brand of products all ive used have been very good
i plan to replace some linksys routerswitches with these the next time they failthis is a great buy if you are looking to split your incoming internet into two or more devicesi bought this for my father so he could have his pc connected to the internet at the same time as his roku box
this was extremely easy to set up even for a  year old who abhors modern day technologyhe did it on his owni would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality cheaply priced ethernet switch
if you are looking for an ethernet cable look at mediabridges products as they are of great qualitygreat switch for small jobs
ive been using it for years  i havent had a single problem with itnetgear has a good reputation and history of making quality products and this is no exception
it is easy to see that they did not sacrifice quality at the cost of making a low price product
it is a simple low end switch so dont look for features that is not what it was designed for and where the cost savings comes fromjust plug it in and it works perfect
your router will assign an ip automatically and your are off and running
no software to install or anything
bam donegreat price with rebate
installed fine and got my dvr blu ray and tv all on the internet at once  small box that is easily hidden and can be wall mounted though i have not done thatas with all ethernet switches it should be pretty straight foward to plug in and connected
this is the second one ive used
the first one has been up and running on my work network  for over  years with no issues
this one i hooked up on my home network and worked as expected found connections and i was up and runnning as fast as i could hook up the cablesi have many of netgears switches
they have all working been well for a long time
slightly more expensive than some brands but worth itive always liked netgears line of simple desktop hubs and switches
theyre small simple wellconstructed and they work no fuss
this one and ones like it with more ports have been on the market for years seemingly unchanged  probably because they work as advertised for a good pricethis one is no different
im happy to see that they have replaced the old wallwart linear power supplies with a more modern switching supply
this will waste less power which is nice on something that will be plugged in basically all the timehook up was a breeze does what it is supposed to
i use the additional connection for my web based garage door openers
cannot comment if there is decay in data transferalthough this says its five ports its not really
one port is taken up with your internet link so you can attach four additional items to this
this switch comes with a power supply so you need a plug near by to use it
it worked right out of the box without needing to install any software
i have a windows  laptop and a sony bluray player attached to it
i feel i have definitely gotten my moneys worth
netgear makes a good quality productthis switch has been a pleasant surprise
i have a cable that runs from a router in my house to my office which is located in a separate building behind the house
the switch is in my office and performs flawlessly
i have a desktop connected to the switch and am able to transfer large files with ease
i have a phone system connected to it that works better than my landline
i have a wireless access point connected to it for the use of my netbook which is located on the opposite side of my office
this has been a unexpectedly useful investmentthis netgear model has been around for a while
i use a lot of them in my small business
theyre very handy to park on conference tables and desks to provide wired internet connections for multiple people
its a very solidly built model all metal with a nofrills industrial design and small footprint
installation is a snap  just plug in the power supply connect your pcsperipherals with regular patch cables and your donetwo issues this is not a gigabit switch just an oldfashioned  switch
if youre just using it for internet connections thats probably fine since youll be limited by your internet speed anyway
but if youre running a gigabit ethernet and want to move gigs over the network quickly youll need a faster switch assuming all the other gear on your network is also gigabit speed i have had a couple of this switches fail over the years and its always been the power supply that failed not the switch
given how cheap these are now id suggest that you buy a spare just to have the spare power supply on hand if you cant afford to have a network failure for more than a few minutes
if the power supply fails you can plug in a new power supply in under a minute which is easier than replacing a whole switch
i dont want to make it seem like the netgear power supply is unreliable  ive had two power supplies fail over the past four years
i just wanted to provide a bit of useful just in case advice for small businessesthis was just what i was looking for
it networks my pcs perfectly and can now share printers etc
without dropping out of the connection
sturdy construction
great pricei use this small switch to share the single ethernet port on my living room to all tv stand devices
i left it always on for the last  months and it never gave any problem or had to be reset
highly recommendedwith the rebate it turns to be one of the cheapest small switch available but still it looks great qualityneeded to add ethernet ports to my home pc installation but had no spare ports on the linksys routerthis netgear box solved that problem quickly and with minimal installation hasslewell being a simple switch there is not much to say about looks and feels well built works just fine
does not warm up very nice product
will buy againi buy this product because i trust netgear when i open the packageit is a solid product works very well  i like itif you want a good solid low cost switch this is it
ive installed dozens of these and theyve proved to be quite reliable
the housing is metal not some cheap plastic and the switch works welli like this fs line of netgears  and port  switches because the status lights are on each jack
you dont have to match up a jack number on one side with a light number on the other side
ive had several at work and at home and not one has ever failed on me
its wallmountable
and they now come with a small lightweight energyefficient ac adapter instead of the huge heavy one that netgears had been known for
the  rebate process went smoothly though i received it on a visa card rather than a check
i tucked this switch in my brotherinlaws tv furniture to network his tv bluray player and wiii love how heavy duty this switch feels
it probably works the same as the rest but has a nice substantial feel to it
plus i though of going all gigabit but in a home setting do you really need it
if you have download speeds of  mbps thats for the whole house and is super fast if you have  thats phenomenal but probably more than you need to have  rokus streaming at once so save a little cash and this should meet you needs just finenetgear is dependable and wellworth the money
i use these network switches in many different applications at work and ive never had a problem with any of them
if youre lucky enough to catch them with a rebate offer just remember they limit you to two of any single modeladds more ethernet ports just fine
easy set up and no problems
metal case and well made
i would recommend this productnicely built desktop switch box
actually mad out of metal instead of plastic
allows needed room to expand any of your ethernet cable componentsits netgear so its gotta be good
just plug it in and gono need to fool around with some brand x product when you can get the good stuff for so little moneythis solved my problem for needing additional ports
i was going to buy another router with additional ports but while researching the routers i found this switch
you just plug it in and instantly have more ports
much cheaper than buying another router
so far it has been great and i am sure i will never need more ports than this switch providesi purchased two of these switches to extend my home network i needed two switches to accommodate upstairsdownstairs locations in home
they provide additional ports on a netgear fvs prosafe vpn firewall with builtin  port switch
i also have two wireless networks connected to the wired network one supports video from a surveillence camerainstallation was a breeze with nothing to configure i wallmounted one switch and installed the second on the floor next to the outlet jack at my upstairs locationthese switches provide many network configuration options and ive used netgear products for years with no problems
i expect the same will be true with these switchesive had this for a few months now and it still works perfect
id have no reason to think why it would not continue to function perfectly
it is built nice and solid
it was  i believe with a  rebate which i received right away
if you need a simple switch for your home office look no furthernot too much to say about these units other than they work really well
very affordable and well built  the only switch i buy when i need these for clientsi purchased this switch to be able to connect two computers to one home run on my wired network no problems and works reall goodboy its hard to beat this switch for the money
i bought this switch to expand my uverse router port counti now have an ooma telo home phone an att microcell g and a obi office phone plugged into this netgear switch and then  single cable goes from the netgear switch to the uverse wire router
no configuring setup management etc
neededi plug the following directly into my uverse router  my desktop computer my hp laptop computer with docking station an actiontec powerline networking module which sends lan over the outlets of my house to my lg d tv
so far everything is very stable and im pleased because i now have available ports and can do everything im trying to do from a networking perspectivein short i highly recommend this switch
it is literally so easy a caveman could do iti bought this to supplement my internet connections for my home theater system
i have my office with modem and router upstairs and powerline networking for downstairs
lots of people dump on powerline but i have no problem with it
i used this connection for my ps because i personally hate wifi especially for gaming
i recently upgraded my tv and theater system to internet connectible equipment
my options were to buy a new powerline adapter for the multiple new connections use an old router i had laying around as a switch or buy something like this
i am glad i went this routethe unit is very solid and heavier than you would expect just looking at it but that doesnt matter because you wont be holding it
it really is as trouble free to install as everyone says
i have zero loss of speed in ps
i can even can still stream vudu in hdx with full strength
this unit is attached to a belkin conserve power strip and comes on like a charm everytime power is restored
if it helps those with a similar setup heres what i gotsony bravia  tv ethernet connected sony bluray home theater system ethernet connected and ps ethernet connected to this switch
everything is connected to belkin conserve smart fcq av energy saving power strip tv masterwith netgear powerline adapter providing the internet connection from my upstairs netgear routerand finally yes it is only  but find me one thing in your home starting with your modem and signal from your isp that needs more
if you arent a business or have a super home network based on  you really dont need it
this will be fine for  of everyone and perfect for home theater usesthese have been staple for years
you cant get any better than this
for folks out there that are new to networking you actually want one of these switches compared to a hub because switches will streamline your network and make it run more smoothly
when you use a hub the ip packets will collide and the qos services of your network card will be doing overtime to get your data to the next target
switches analyse these packets and deliver them out the proper port to the actual destination
i can highly recommend these to anyone building their professional or home networki was concerned about my hookup situation as i have one switch box in a bedroom running to my computer and needed to see if i could hook up another behind my tv in the living room
wasnt quite sure if running from one switch box to another would even work or if i would get the speed i needed for hd streaming from amazon and netflix
all i can say it that it works great
no problems no issues
one cable from the bedroom to the box behind the tv and two cables from the box one to the bluray player and one to the roku box with hdmi cables to the tv
again works great
and the price on this box was a lot cheaper than my local stores
thanks amazoni needed this to add a network printer in a different room than my router
i already had a cable run to the other room for my laptop wired is faster than its wireless card which runs linux ubuntu
installation is probably too complex a wordliterally i just plugged in the power cord plugged in my cable from my router and then plugged in my computer and printerand it just worked
i have a fasterthanaverage internet connection docsis and tested the speed both with without the switch and it was the same mbs download mbs upsimple
simple
simple
fantastic
this device is exactly what it says it is an ethernet switchi ran out of ports on my router and needed something simple to expand  this is it
fantastic
is very fast no gimmicks or nonsense
plug it in plug into router and you have four additional ports ready to work flawlessly at lightening speedi would buy this againnetgear has made a great switch at a great price point
simply be aware that one of the five ports will be utilized to tie into another switch the router or the network in general so only four ports remain useable to expand your network
this is a very handy device where you have a single network connection run to say a bed room or to an entertainment center but then need to add multiple devices to the network say a network printer a roku box such asroku  xs p streaming player etc
would buy again though if you need more ports check outnetgear fs prosafe port fast ethernet desktop switchproduct works really great as i hooked the cable wire into port  and  off the other  into my samsung tv and my roku and itdoes a really good job
being hardlined to my internet router it is really fast and i really love it
the instruction manualdid not indicate which port to plug in the internet cable into but after calling the company the best one was port  althoughyou could plug into any port and also with the cables coming off but i feel  is the bestas nice as wifi would be if it worked reliably for everyone it can be a nightmare for those that are not networking experts
in my experience with wifi devices ive spent hours working with customer support trying to get them working
i decided one day that i have lost to many hours of my life trying to avoid those cat cables besides a lot of us already have spaghetti wire messes in our house from all our electronic gagets 
with this device as with others you just plug in the cables and the power and the rest takes care of its selfthis item worked just fine it came ready to go it was well packaged with instructions it did the job i had hoped for i had a blind spot in my home wifi system so with this i was able to run the cable and provide internet to a part of the house known as the dead zonemore of a commodity purchase i bought not for a specific purchase but more to grab and use when needed
netgear makes great products and ive never had problems with any of their switches
be sure to note this is not a  switch but it is reflected in the priceadded a second computer to our hdhomerun media center in the den and this made it easy
it took  minutes from the time i started hooking up the netgear prosafe until it was complete
both computers were already up and running before i started
one was on a cat cable and the other one on a usb wifi stick
now they are both hard wired to the router using this switchive had this on  for the past month or two and it seems to work ok  it acts as a subnet with  computers on it
it then hooks into another switch that is configurable but two computers use one port into iti have always liked the netgear switches
solid reliable and well priced
i needed something at the end of a long run to add another component vs homerunning another cate cable back to the main switch
works just fine
autonegotiates appropriately and no issues pegging it at mbps throughputwith switch prices coming down to about perport its hard to justify buying anything less than a switch for all but the most costconscious buyeras most port  switches have the same capabilities and cost about the same theres not much to distinguish one from another
still i particularly like the netgear fs port switch
like other products from netgear this switch is a little nicer than the competition because it has nice sturdy metal construction instead of plastic
the case also has a grounding tab in case youre using the switch in a electrically highnoise environment connection status indicators built into the jacks so you can easily tell which cable is connected and is active
the quotvistajackquot feature
 rightangled barrel power connector which reduce the likelihood of disconnecting power accidentally an easytoaccess switch to toggle port  between station mode and uplink mode
unlike some hubs where two jacks are wired together this design prevents accidentally shorting a station to an uplink screwmount notches on the underside allows for easy attachment to the wall underside of a counter etcwith a mac address buffer and  kbytesperport packet buffer this switch can easily handle the typical traffic load of small and mediumsized networksthe netgear product is not the cheapest switch check out the dlink fast ethernet switch for example but for overall design and valueformoney i still like the netgear the mostwhat can i say this little box is plug and play
i was out of ethernet ports so needed a switch two years ago and it still works greatbought this  port ethernet switch after hearing its iffy on whether it would work
well im glad to say it definitely does
didnt even feel any delays on slingbox or netflix movie streamingsolid switch
works with my llinuxbased computer where one of those green switches didnt
i read that the power connector was short and would disconnect
i find no truth to that though im not yanking on it all the time
also doesnt feel hot at all which is something else that ive read about this switchi have used literally hundreds of little  port switches
i prefer the netgear prosafe switches for their solid construction and good power supplies
while they may not necessarily be the cheapest switch out there they have been solid in every environment i have put them in
enclosed in higher temp cabinets to under a desk they always perform perfectly without a problemi got sick and tired of the flaky wireless connection for my ps and xbox  i dont have a hardwire ethernet connection in the game room so i bought an actiontec powerlink ethernet connection twin packruns ethernet over your homes power lines
anywayi have a power link module ps and xbox connected to the netgear fs switch and everything works perfectlythis stopped my problem with my wireless router kicking my hard wired connectioni had to restart both routers oftennow i have a dedicated wire to  bedrooms att microcell and wireless routerbetter than i thought havent been kicked since i hooked it upthe  ports consists of  input and  outputim very pleased with this switch and highly recommend iti bought this to direct wire my netflix  bluray player
ran the ethernet from the other side of the house plugged it in and forgot about it
no issues to dateneeded to add some more drops at home  this switch was totaly painless
plug it in  your doneworked great right out of the box
this is the kind of quality that i expect from netgear
now if they can figure out a way to eleminate the wall wartthe netgear fs is a great port ethernet switch housed in a nice metal case
you simply plug it in and it works
got it for  after the  mailin rebate
highly recommendedthis is a great switchthe offer says 
rebatebe ware this is a  prepaid debit card good on the purchase of another netgear unit no  cashit is a computer ethernet desktop switch that promises what it says it will deliver
the cost seemed very fair alsowhat else can i really say
inexpensive  port switch its exactly what i wanted
now i dont have to deal with wifi dropping in my apartment every once in a whileneeded this to complete the integrated wiring in my house
i simply plugged everything in and now i have live ethernet jacks in all my bedrooms
great stuff and a perfect little device with no hassle setup
its just a switch so its not like theres much to go wrong but you can be confident this one worksmy internet provider told me i would need a router and if i just used a switch to try to connect both computer and dvd player to the modem my internet would slow to a crawl or not work
i have only the cheapest dsl connection
i thought i would just try this and see what happens
i plugged my dsl modem into the netgear switch and then plugged my new dvd player into the switch and turned everything on
i chose the netflix option on the player and it connected got my code entered into the netflix website and i was instantly streaming my movie
my internet speed has not suffered at all
i would not be using the internet and watching a movie at the same time but i tried using the internet while the movie was on just to see
no loss of speed
this little switch was the solution i neededswitches all eventually burnout especially the cheap ones
this is an older  model which is plenty fast for homesmalloffice use and should give you a good  years of usei love these particular models
they work great
they are well madei have owned several netgear products and these are my favorite
if you want a router or a switch that will last look to these firstthey are super affordable to bootgood stable cheap switch
its a great durable little switch that works perfectly for the home office or small office that doesnt need a lot of ports or a managed switchi needed a specific style of splitter to augment my wired network at work
when i simply used a wifi router to distribute the signal among various computer i ran into a recognition problem with outlook and my employers network
i discovered that for outlook to work the network name needed to be specific
adding a router created a unique set of ip and network credential and while connectivity remained i was stucki tried a splitter in the most traditional sense it was literally was a splitter just like the type used in electric
but whether it was broken or simply failed to work im unsurethe solution is this desktop ethernet switch in this case a  port which like its larger sibs simply replicates the port and augments ip distribution
this little unit has mounting screws if you wanted to surface mount or it can simply sit on the desk
its powered by an adapter to ac and doesnt get hot
its multifunctional in terms of bandwidth and will scale for youthe perfect solution for me as i cabled from the ethernet jack to the switch then from the switch to my pc  wifi router with additional access ports to spare
this model is available with  or  portswe use a number of these cost effective switches in a variety of applications
great for multiple computers in the same area
great price point too
netgear is always a good buy
very simple installcouldnt be easierrather than buy separate powerline adaptors for devices that are right next to each other i used this small switch
a on the durable metal construction i expect years of loyal service from this device
i will rate it  stars once i receive my mailin rebatei needed to share an internet connection between a network drive and a computer and this switch did the trick
nothing to install  just plug and go could not have been easier
and the footprint is nice and small
finally performance rocks  throughput is very fastthe less there is to say about a switch the better
thus ill just say that the build quality is solid metal not plastic and ive yet to have a problemwe recently changed to a fiber optic internet provider and wished to hook both of our computers up to it
this tiny little box does a great job
we used cate patch cables to connect the computers to the switch
the set up was simple and quick and weve had no problems so farim not hiding that i like netgear products for entry level use
this device has a th port that you can use in uplink or normal mode
it is very compact with indicator lights for connection and collisions
it is also very reliablenice small switch works immediately after plugging
plugged it to a dlink router to split internet connection and feed all my pcs works greatif you need extra ports for you network these work great and are ruggedly built
the metal case should take a beating and aid in coolingthis is by far the simplest fastest easiest installation of network equipment ive ever done
even the box was easier to open than most open top instead of slideout like all the crap i usually end up withthis switch is nice and heavy  has a very solid rugged feel
dont know if it will hold up for years but it looks like it could be around longer than me
no cheap plastic heretook it out of the box plugged it in and hooked it up  i was golden ltmin total setup time and no problemslikesprice i got it for  after rebatedurabilitysize very small  they did a good job being spaceefficientdislikesdidnt come with a ponyworks perfectlyi wish it were faster but for the money i couldnt ask for more
i has never failed meso far i am impressed with this switch
the small footprint and the ease of installation is really something to behold
it has been reliable as well as a small unmanaged switch should bei debated on whether to get a gigabit switch or a fast ethernet mbps switch
i decided to be cheap and went for this little switch
i also have an old mbit ethernet switch by netgear that only had four sockets and one had to be designated for uplink
that little switch was the part of a reason for taking the netgear though it was small and it was reliable
in that regard the switch did not disappointwhat did disappoint me was though the fact that file transfers between two peer computers ie
not to the internet took longer than expected
the peak transfer rate could not go beyond mbs that is expected and totally fine for my dsl and for streaming from one computer to another to an extent but i found it to be sluggish as the transfer rate i had from an external usb to hard drive could go for mbs or higheri gave full marks due to the fact that it was a great switch for its class
the problem is though that the class itself is showing signs of age
for those of you who would like to set up a home server i recommend you make a jump to the realm of gigabit ethernetdesired a small switch to share a single ethernet connection to multiple items in my entertainment center tv bluray sat tv box etc
this is a nice compact switch that easily mounted on the back of the cabinet and allowed the single internet cat cable running in the wall to my router to be shared on multiple devices
plugged in power line to network and then to devices all was neededthis switch is still working after more than a year and is mounted in a hothumid hallway with f temperatures all summer
i paid  including shipping and used a  rebate worth it so far this appears to be holding up and working good
it is made in china and the first type i bought that was made in china crapped out after a month
so far this one is workingwe purchased this for an office upgrade that installed an ethernet drop in the wall
after the drop was installed we exit the drop directly into the netgear fs switch
the fs gives us other ports which we use for other devices
its fast and reliablethe netgear fs is a mainstay in the corporate world
i work for a defense contractor and we have a number of these floating around the software integration and engineering rd departments
theyre inexpensive easy to set up and simple to use
their footprint is very small and they can be easily mounted to a wall or situated on a desk or table without taking up much space
the switch comes with a dc adapter that plugs in the wall
i have mine mounted on the wall above the ethernet dropeach port contains led indicators that provide visual status for what is connected
the case is all metal and very sturdy
the switch contains no fans so it is virtually silent
overall this is a great switch for the price
highly recommendedbe sure to review the technical specifications for this switch to ensure it is adequate for your installationive had this for almost a year now and it is still going strong
theres not much to say about it plug in your cables and go
doesnt require a whole lot of set up
its also lowprofile and feels like solid make
very happy with this purchasethis device does exactly what its supposed to
i have a few of them around the office and theyve held up to a few years of use alreadythis is a splitter so that you can have multiple ethernet ports plugged in and dont need a router
this works wonderfully even if you have a router and still need more ports
this is a compact device as well and the only mildly inconvenience is that it needs to be plugged in to a power outletneeded extra ethernet ports and this did just what i wanted
plugged everything in  connected it to my router and everything worked fineto this very day nancy has never let me down and for that she received the glorious fiverif you dont own her already do it
she is like no woman on earththis is very easy to use just plug in the things you need and plug in the power and away it goes
no problems over the more than two years it has been usedworks as advertised plug and play
i will say it survived the drop test accidentally dropped it about  feet onto concrete floor and works fine
why get a half duplex hub when you can have the full duplex switch
after rebate this was  cant beat thatthis economical little box replaced another which didnt work well
i wont name the other brand but this is clearly superior in quality performance and sturdiness
i attached this to a wall in the closet which has become devoted to internet communications within my home
netgear will be my first brand choice for the next network replacementwell i had to many items under my tv and although they are all wireless road runner kept giving me an excuse about how many wireless devices i had was my problem and i needed to upgrade to lightening  i think they tell everyone that to get more money
well i did upgrade and still had the same problem
being a retired network engineer i knew that if a wireless device is sitting idle or not turned on its not taking bandwidth well i ran a cat  to the tv and hooked the hub up
so now the kids can use everything without any problemsi bough two of theseoktypical netgearhigh quality easy setup competitively priced
ive been using netgear products for  years  will continue to do sowith the purchase of a new internet ready d tv we needed to extend our network to our rec room
while our wireless can reach there we wanted the solid performance and security of a hardwired connection to both the tv and the bluray player
our house is already wired for network so it was as easy as patching from the router to one of these switches in the rec room and then plug the tv and bluray in
now were streaming movies music and bluray content with no hiccups and a painless installation
top it off with us purchasing it at a low price along with a  rebate and this couldnt be beatyou need one router on a home network
the modem plugs into it
the router provides dhcp to assign nat addresses
a switch has two uses if you need more jacks than your router provides if you have a long ethernet cable to another room where you need more than oneconnection in an office that has one jack and you need more than onecame on time and works as expected
nice product good service
device has some decent weight to it so that it wont move around easily when stationed ethernet switching how can you go wrong
until the recent demise of the networking industry i worked for bay networksnortel networks and remember raving about  switches when they dropped to the unheard of price
wow
an ethernet switch in my home officenice price fast shipping and works just like it is supposed to used to connect multiple pcs in a conference roomnetgear has always produced excellent and reliable products  this little switch is no exception
a high quality heavy duty metal case  unlike most of the competitions plastic casesthis is awesome especially for the cost
just plug and play
i have  port modemswitch from verizon for my internet and needed more lines hooked up in my house then just the   so took this plugged into the modemswitch and bang  more ports nothing else to do
if you need to expand your wired device this is a great addition
just plug it in and your all set to gothis item does exactly what it is meant to do and it is very easy to work with even for people like me who do not know much about computersgot this little switch to go in my living room so i could connect my av receiver ps and directv dvr
setup is a no brainer and the quality of this little unit is superbive been using netgear products for years both for business and home
ive never been disapointed in any of their products
i purchased this switch to replace a oldercheaper one that worked about half the time
using for smart tv and computer internet in residential garage man caveeasy set up  just connect power cord  plug all ethernet cable that you need for maxium  port  wait until all green light turn on  you are done  especially work for slingbox without firewall blockingthe switch has worked flawlessly since day one
the metal case is a nice touch as it is being used in a classroom environment  the sturdier the better for meridiculously easy to set up
lightweight but with sturdy construction
i like having the lights and inputs on the same side
rebate offer made this a very sweet deal indeedi had an older version of this that is at least  years old
i have an xbox  xbox  and ps all in one room with one outlet
this did the trick
install was straight forwardi had one ethernet port and two devices
what to do oh i got it get a switch
why choose this switch you ask
cause i had another one for a similar dilemma and it works
that one has worked for years keeping my xbox and bluray happy
now i expect the same from this one for my pc and voip
way to go layer two devicei recently replaced my cable provider with atts uverse a combination of internet cable tv and telephone
my pcs and other devices were hooked together with a linksys network but the installer told me that the linksys devices wouldnt work properly with his equipment and everything had to hook directly into the att box
after pulling lots of cable he hooked up  devices and that was it
everything else had to be wireless or i was told to get a netgear switch
after some internet research i found i could probably get the linksys to work but the netgear was reasonably priced and should be worryfreesure enough the install took all of  minutes including swapping cables from the att box to the netgear box
everything worked perfectly no problems encountered or adjustments neededif you have uverse and need more ports for your devices this is just what youre looking for
if only all networking problems were this easily solvedthis has been a great switch
got a good deal on this one when the newer model came outthis thing works like a champ
the metal construction is far superior to all the plastic competition imo
i recommend this exact model to all that ask menice competitive price
no problem at all installing or using it
it does exactly what it claims
also its very compact sizewisei purchased this switch to expand my network
i have owned one of these netgear  port switches for a few years and have never had a problem so this purchase was a no brainer
this one has been in service for a week with no issuesi would buy it again does the job and is a good value for the quality you get
wish i had bought it soonerive probably used they rarely fail in my experiencei really like the sturdy metal case and the auto uplink detectioni got this as a switch for the other end of the house and the kids video games and computers that werent yet wireless
it worked like a champ
i was a former linksys user but have jumped ship and now use netgear because of their reliability and supportwhat a great product
i plugged a ps xbox two computers and our dsl cable all ethernet cables into this switch and now all four systems have internet connection
it was that simplemy only regret is that i got didnt get the port switch
i didnt realize that the dsl connection goes in one of these front  ports
i thought perhaps there was a port in the back similar to a usb hub
i was hoping to have one port available to plug a laptop in but the four systems and dsl connection uses all five available portsi trust netgear products
i had several netgear products and everything works great
no complain at all
more devices i was able to connect with this switch and still get excellent wifi connection from my routeri am not technical but this was easy to use just plugged in lan cable from router and into pc dvd player and tv
speed is goodi needed to add another computer to our lan network at home
i ordered this and it came as notified
getting it setup was easy and no problems
i have had no problem with this switch and very happy with the performance
i now have four computers on the lan and this switch keeps on goingeasy to setup and runs greatgot this to expand ethernet connection to my wireless router
hook up and plug in runs flawlessly
no software to install and no setting to chooseonly one thing potential buyers needs to be aware  there are only  ports available for downstream connection
you need use one to connect to your router modem or whatever gives you internet accessthis network switch works fine
what more can you saysome of the reasons i selected this unit include the metal housing which makes the unit a little heavier and less likely to slip around and the colocation of the status leds with the jacksbe sure to check the dates on other reviews as some of them are just plain wrong
for example this most recent versionmodel does not have an uplink selector switchthe ports configure automatically if you need to uplink to another switch or router
also the power connector is not a rightangle connector on this unitone last notethis unit uses a  vdc power supply so it will not work with all those older  vdc netgear power supplies you have lying aroundi bought this keyboard a couple of weeks ago and i have no regrets
the  hot keys are great for internet surfing and for listening to media files  such as winamp
i also plugged my intellimouse optical into the usb ports  in the back and did not have to use a valuable usb port in the back of my  machine
i would suggest this keyboard to anyone who likes the ergonomic  feel and who spends a lot of time on the internet and listening to or  watching mediathis board is great
hotkeys ergo etci cant wait until you can buy different colored keys for each letterdo use windows without itive had this keyboard for about  year now i think
its only negative is how it works with existing computer furniture that i havewith the curved edge and higher profile  inches high  this keyboard may be a bit big for some computer desks
it effectively takes up about  inches in depth and  inches in width
my desk has the keyboard drawer that pulls out and only has  inches between the drawer top and the desk bottom
it had a strip of wood on the front face as a hand rest that i had to remove in order to use this keyboard
this keyboard has a hand rest of its own
im only mentioning this because it is a common design on some computer desks and may not be as easily removable as mine was
it needed to be removed because it set the keyboard too far back and the drawer was not opening far enough for the top keys to be accessed
also since my keyboard drawer is only  inches wide i only had  inches left for my mouse pad
what i find is that the keyboard occassionally jostles my  inch wide mousepad and it jams against the side of the drawer making it hard to movemy set up works okay for me however if your keyboard drawer is any smaller and you need a larger area for a mouse you might have a problem with this keyboardthe main advantages of this keyboard in my opinion is the sloped design that ergonomically suits the hands better and the usb ports
as a person that has a digital camera i find these usb ports very handy
who wants to fish behind your cpu every time you want to download picturesthis keyboard also has keys at the top of it that do some functions automatically such as mail calculator and my computer which are far to the right over the number keys
additionally you can do all internet functions from back  to home via keys on this keyboard top left over keyboard
i dont find the internet keys so handy as i tend to use the mouse for this
habit from my work keyboard
you also can bring up and control your media player via keys too top right over keyboard
this is handy
you can adjust volume play stop or change to previous and next track
this is neat as you dont have to hunt around for this while in the middle of something elsealso handy are the indicator lights that show that the num lock caps lock and scroll lock is on
they are right in the middle of the keyboard where you cant miss them
for someone that goofs with caps lock on passwords this helps somewhat
ironically due to my work keyboard though i find myself always looking in the wrong spotas for installing this keyboard it was simple
one thing i did find was that on my older  dell machine with windows  i could not get the usb ports to work
i have no idea whether this was a factor of the computer or the keyboard
however now i have a  windows me and they work fine
i have no idea why this happened
i regularly have a usb cd writer attached to one and a digital camera to the otherthis is a decent deal too
i bought this keyboard for almost twice as much and find it an excellent investmentupdate i just realized i did this review  years ago almost  and im typing this update on this very keyboard
sounds like it was a good investment after alli purchased the original ms natural keyboard when they first arrived on the market and my wrists instantly fell in love with it
the new and improved keyboard has better key action than the original the space bar has been enlarged for those of us that type like normal users and not like professional developers
my reason for purchasing the natural keyboard pro over the ms natural keyboard elite was mainly due to the fact that the arrow keys are normally sized
with the natural keyboard elite the arrow keys are scrunched into this diamond shape near the keypad
when i went to use them i would continuously hit all of them at once causing all sorts of chaos and verbal malediction to be uttered by yours trulythe hot keys are a nice feature but i rarely use them except for the sleep and calculator keys
the software included does allow you to customize the mail my computer and calculator keys so you can reassign them to launch any app batch file or pif that you want
the software also allows you to turn off the windows keys on either the left or right side and most importantly it allows you to turn off the application key which can be annoying if youre trying to play games etcto sum its a great keyboard easy to install setup and customize
if you have an original ms natural keyboard you will love this one
if youve got big hands buy this one and skip the natural elitei went from a microsoft natural keyboard elite to a pro and its a magnitude better
the elite was mushy the keys just didnt have any bounce
the pro has more spring
it doesnt have as much response as an ibm model m keyboard but this is so much better than the elite that its general feel is greati hope microsoft brings a keyboard like this one back into full production soonas i write this review from work i wish i were using microsofts natural keyboard pro
i bought two last year and gave one to my aunt if it were possible to fall in love with a keyboard then this thing would steal my  heartthe natural keyboard pro is the true successor to the original  natural keyboard forget about the keyboard elite
this board sports   multimedia quothot keysquot that launch browsers refresh web pages  and much more
there are connectors for usb and ps ports microsoft  recommends plugging the keyboard into both ports although you can use  whatever port you wantkey response is good without feeling mushy and  the builtin wrist rest is good for those users who like to relax theirs  wrists at the bottom of the keyboard
the intellitype software that ships  with the keyboard is version  users of america online will want to  download the patch for compatibility with aols  softwarei like  microsofts latest keyboard
its a good sturdy keyboard with cool  features that are really useful
users with small hands might need some  time to get used to the boards rather large layout even still the natural  keyboard pro is proof that if microsoft quit the software business tomorrow  theyd have a great future in hardware i have to give credit where credit is due and this keyboard is the best of the best in my opiniongetting used to the split shape of this keyboard and any ergonomic keyboard for that matter takes a little getting used to but its not difficult and eventually you wont notice the difference
in fact i find it easy to go back and forth between my keyboard and standard keyboards elsewheremicrosoft keyboards also have a nice solid feel with each keypress
not soft and spongy and not a hard updown click either but a nice touch
my last natural purchased when they first started making them was very reliable and only died once i spilled a large quantity of soda on it
i was then presented with the opportunity to test the rumor of being able to clean your keyboard in the dishwasher it doesnt help
the buttons on the top are helpful and i didnt find any problems with system crashes
most of the buttons are media player related playstop ffwd prev next volume and the others are internet related back fwd stop refresh  personally the only button i really use is the calculatorother than reliability and feel i think the main reason to buy this over cheaper keyboards is for the extra usb ports
newer computer manufacturers have wised up to the fact that usb ports might be better placed on the front of the case rather than the back
if youre not one of these lucky souls with usb ports in the front or you just need a couple extra usb ports then this is a good way to get themlastly some other reviewer wrote repeatedly about the number  being in the wrong place err ok  i didnt even notice and even if thats true and theres some kind of ergonomic keyboard book of law which i doubt i never had any problem adjusting to ithope my review helpedi understand this keyboard is no no longer easily available
i bought one at a local secondhand store for  and am happy with it
the keys are rather loud and clicktyclack but its study
the blue bottons on the top arent that useful
but its a very comfortable keyboard to use
i like the wrist rest especially and the spacebar works well
i like the usb ports on the kb i plug my usb mouse into one and the other is free for now
highly recommended if you can find oneok i admit it  ive only used this keyboard for one day but couldnt wait to write a review
first off i can rightly claim to be an official mac enthusiastfanatic since buying my st computer blue amp white g mhz in  and understand some of the mac communitys loathing of microsoft
but if a product works this terrifically for the mac even if its a microsoft product then we should show our support for the mac by buying the superior product
when apple offers an equally fine splitkeyboard ill trade this one in for that but at this time they dont have onei have experienced the superior stressreducing ergonomics of the split keyboard design for a couple of years now with the adesso truform keyboard which is also a fine keyboard but this one from microsoft is a cut above the rest
note that i have also briefly tried the datadesk smartboard splitkeyboard which was also a fine product but the keys on that board made very audible clicking sounds  a real distraction when youre used to silent keys
fortunately the microsoft keyboard keys are very quietthe keyboard is indeed wide but not as wide as the adesso truform keyboard
the keys on this microsoft board are soft to the touch but with a responsiveness that i find perfect not mushy like the apple pro keyboard
just plug in the usb cable and youre ready to go though there is a cd included that contains some very useful software to allow you to reprogram many of the hot keys to your liking and to mirror those keys that are on the mac keyboard such as the command and option keys all reprogramming was super easy and worked flawlessly for me
all the keys worked as advertised the volume control keys the internet hotkeys they work with ie or netscape the reprogrammed apple command keys and more
the comments about the products plastics feeling cheap are totally unfounded  this is a solid product with thick plastic moldings throughout
the cd also installs informative hmtl help files on the subject of proper keyboard usage posture carpaltunnel symptoms etc
 this is really a complete packageif you are someone that is about to embark on the blissful path of the splitkeyboard then this is the keyboard to buy  its the best one one out there for the mac
you wont turn backi have been using this keyboard for about two years now and i think it is the best keyboard i have ever used
i use many diffrent keyboards at school friends house laptop and none of them compare to this keyboard
when i first started using this keyboard i was a quothunt and peckquot typist but over time i became a touch typist and this keyboard is perfect for that
i dont have any pain using it for hours at a time compared with other keyboards
i would recommend this keyboard to anyone
the two usb ports are also a great feature since i plug my microsoft intellimouse optical a fantastic mouse into it and it reduces wire clutterive been a fan of the ms natural keyboards since they came out working at microsoft when they did i made sure i had as many of them as i could
turns out my hoarding was appropriate given their next offering the  natural keyboard elite was such a disappointment
so it was with great  pleasure i found after snapping one up on release day that the third  times a charm
first off it retains the split design of its forebears  which is so much easier on the wrists
the control buttons across the top  are a nice addition i use the media controls the most when playing songs  in winamp and poke the larger email button to launch outlookk
the  internet browser controls are of less use if you have grown accustomed to  navigation using regular keystrokes theyre tougher to get to rather than  just a quick f etc
the travel between key presses has been lessened so  you dont have to push as far on say the ctrl button to activate it as  you did in the first version
this tends to produce a little cushier  typing experience but its worth it
they also returned the beloved  inverted t arrow controls instead of the horrid cross of the elite
this  design is preferable when playing games wout joysticks or mice like a  quick round of mame emulated pacman
should also mention the presence  of the two usb ports in the back for mousetrackball use
the keyboard  itself comes w a dual usbps connector and is physically smaller than  the original
being on computers  hours a day i have this keyboard and  the logitech marble trackman fx see review on all my machines work and  home
highly recommendedi received this product as a xmax gift
it took about and hour or two to get used to the split keyboard but it was smooth sailing after that
the only problem that i had which was resolved a few hours after use was the quieter key action when typing
it does not take much pressure to type on the keyboard which is a bit of change for me
this was however resolved a few hours after usei find that my hands and fingers get fatigued less often than with my previous keyboard just a standard flat keyboard
ive also noticed that my typing speed has increased being that it is more comfortable to type
what i really like about the keyboard is the shortcut keys a musthave feature for any keyboard
i do not use many usb devices but when i do it is very handy to have  ports right at the keyboardthe microsoft natural keyboard pro is an excellent product after the short learning curve it allowed me to type faster and more comfortably than ever before
i would recommend this to anyone who expirences any type of fatigue when using a traditional flatstyle kayboard or would rather type more naturally hence the name i spent a fair amount of dithering before i bought this keyboard
not that its excessively expensive
rather it looked a bit of an ugly duckling up there on the shelf and i wasnt sure if it would be comfortable enoughon my third trip to the shelf i finally studied it a bit more carefully
i noticed the little messages on the keys to remind my failing mind of control functions
i noticed the special function keys that provided web navigation media control instant access to my computer and the calculator and the sleep key
i noticed the volume control keys
i remember that i hadstarted to turn off the sound on my klisch s because their volume occasionally gave the cats heart attacksi figured quotwhat the heck ive made dumber mistakesquot and brought one home
i already had an old grungy intellipoint keyboard so intallation took about  seconds of hardware time and a minute to install the software
quotso far so goodquot i say to myself
one star for installationtest one typing
ooh the extra large wrist rest that looked so ugly in the store looks pretty good
and the angle feels a bit better
the keys have a nice thunk and a springy feel
one star for feelnext i try the volume control  wow
the look of worry vanishes from the cats faces
the rest of the media keys work fine and the internet navigators are great
when i hit the sleep button my machine does exactly that
one star for cool featuresthe software is simplicity itself
adjustments for speed language hotkeys some special options and a nifty little on screen display for keys like volume
everything works just great
one star for easy of use and clear instructionsthe last star is for the two usb ports on the back of the keyboard
this basically changes one of the usb ports from the back of my machine into two on my desk
works great for a mouse and in my case a zip driveive gotten used to the original funny shaped intellitype
this new model seems like the perfect set of improvements in functionality and ergonomics
given the amount of time i spend with my fingers on the keyboard its well worth the moneyi have tendonitis in my wrist so finding something that was comfortable  and unobtrusive was essential
this keyboard fit the bill perfectly
i now  use this keyboard both at home and at work
its a tired analogy but it  rings true here using this keyboard is like trying on that pair of jeans  that fit you just right
you wont want to go back to anything lesseveryone asks the same question isnt this keyboard hard to get used  to
i too thought it would take weeks but i was comfortable with it after  two days  hrsday
i find the builtin wrist rest to be quite good and  the row of multimedia keys are a nice bonus feature great to be able to  mute your music or adjust the volume with a quick keypress especially if  you use headphonesno regrets but there are two downsides you should  be aware of  you may become more sensitive to nonergonomic keyboards i  get aches after using any cramped laptop keyboard now normal keyboards are  still ok just less comfortable  and  the rearrangement of the  function keys makes them a bit of a chore to get used toi have had this keyboard for over a year and have dumped several glasses of pop and water into it
it is still working fine and the usb hub is very convienient if you have a digital camera or ipaq etc
no problems whatsoeverthe title sums it up
this is the best and most comfortable keyboard i have ever used
i am a very fast touch typist with a very heavy touch since i learned on mechanical typewriters remember those
not even an electrical assist
this keyboard lets me go faster gives me far far less fatigue and repetitive stress pain than any other and ought to be the standardas i said i bang the keys pretty hard
the natural keyboard pro just keeps on working happily mine is at least  years old and going strong
normally i bash an ibm or dell or any other keyboard into destruction within a yeari love this keyboard and i use it one at work and at home
a clean traditional key layout with shortcut buttons that actually work thanks to the excellent intellitype software
the key response is the best ive used since the old ibm keyboards of the s
the keys are solid stiff and emit a nice tactile click when you press them
you wont find any keyboard flex or mushyspongy key response that youll find in some of the cheaper noname keyboards you can buy elsewhere for less
microsoft has done their homework with this onethe included wristrest completes this great setup
if youre looking for a basic keyboard and dont require dozens of quickstart keys or the latest rfwireless model youd be hard pressed to find anything better than this one
take it from me i use mine all day at work and at home on my own pcthe standard ms keyboard has that tactile feel that most modern keyboards lack
go look on ebay for the keyboards from the s they carry a high premium because of how they were made how the keys sound respond and feel
this is not as good as that but its much better than most anything you will find in stores now
im not sure why they dont go back and at least offer one of the s style keyboards for say  in their line up
it makes typing so much easier quicker and more pleasantive used just about every keyboard on the market but this one is certainly my favorite
ive got four of them two at work and two at home
they never seem to wear out like other keyboards and take a considerable beating
once a coworker was helping me move my desk and put my keyboard on the floor
he began picking up the monitor a quot but it slipped out of his hands and landed on the poor keyboard
a dozen keys shot off and the little feet on the bottom of it snapped out
that was six months ago that same keyboard is still in my office and working perfectly
you cant beat thati bought this keyboard a few years ago at a store
i feel in love with the touch on it while testing it out there
all was well for years
then one morning my cat knocked my mug of coffee over and it poured all down right into the keyboard
i had no hopes to finding a replacement but did
it arrived quickly same old keyboard in stunning new shape
i should buy another
keyboards with a nice touch are very difficult to come by
the programmed button shortcuts are handy too
can not say a bad thing about it
im not much for wrist rests but i even like the one that comes with this keyboard
it is a ps interface which means its the round plug in not the rectangular usb one
make sure you have an ps to usb adopter on hand if you dont have a ps interfacei have had this keyboard for years now
i really do not use the quotinternetquot keys but i really like the calculator key seeing how im always looking to do a quick calculationit might not be as quite as other keyboards but the keys feel fine to push and after years they have not broke or got stikky and i have used it alot dailythe arm rest is the best feature along with the huge spacebar
the keys feel very natural and i like how they slope up
well worth the moneyhope this helpsthis is about the best deal on outdoor lighting i have ever seen
easy to install worked the first time
yes you do need to caulk around it to keep mosture from getting into the seam but i do that with every outdoor projecti read the reviews and quite frankly im baffled
though some of the reviews gave this light a bad review im not
this is a great light it picks up the slightest movement and that is exactly what i needed
the span of it was surprisingly wide and on cue when tested
if you need a cheap but good light this is itits a decent motion sensor that can be added to pretty much any light fixture with space to add itits cheaper than buying a new light and it works great
have not had an issue
has good range and only works at night it that is what you wantwed had a sensor fail on an existing light and i ordered this to replace it
the older unit was from a different manufacturer but looked identical and carried the same model number
installation was straightforwardi simply removed the existing wire nuts removed the old unit from the light housing and reversed the process to install the new one
it works dependably as advertisedthis was a much cheaper option than buying a new motion flood light fixturebought three of these to detect motion around the deck and pool area and activate several flood lights and wall sconce units simultaneously
the instructions say this has to be wired to a switched circuit but i have no idea why
worked fine coming right off a live circuit
coverage is probably a little less than d  but it worked well for methe instructions dont cover this if you want to add multiple sensors to a single or multiple lights simply get some g wire and wire it up like you would a  way switch or get an electrician to do it
i love the idea that weve got such broad motion detection coverage from the three sensors and all the lighting works simultaneously
little more complicated and expensive wiring job but much better for me than having individual units that work independentlyi was glad to be able to just buy the sensor rather than replace the entire fixture
it was an easy replacement turn the breaker off first
the unit has sensitivity adjustment and instructions as to angle so you neighbor does not light your yard while getting his newspaper  feet away
it has worked very reliable for several months in some nasty weatherif your motion sensor isnt working on distances over  feet get this one
i started out with this one and a  watt halogen rectangular light
the sensor worked but the  watt halogen did not put out enough light for my cameras
i removed both and installed an all in one sensor  light combo with screw in bulbs so i could use two  watt par  ge flood light screw in bulbs
now i had plenty of light but the motion sensor was not working at the distance i needed
i removed the wires from the all in onesensor and reinstalled this sensor and now all is great
try and steal my mail now just make sure you smile for the camera here are the bulbs i used that work great  httpwwwamazoncomgpproductbfppnurefohdetailsosiieutfpsci bought one of these at home depot and it cost me twice as much as this on line purchase from amazon
when the perimeter lights fail this is the gadget that dies
if you are up to the job just replace the sensor
everything is color coded
what i did was build my own motion detected perimeter light set up using this for the sensor
it cost me less than buying one as a unithad a pair of these for about  years and they still work
i am replacing  sensors that were burned during a storm and a surgecannot say anything bad about the zenith sensors because they are and have been reliable for yearsit was easy to replace the defective sensor
it has been in service for several months and comes on every time i expect it to be oni have it on for minute and it always goes off on time
the daylight sensor works as designedthis works great i wired it into the porch lights to turn on when someone is on the porch at nighti hacked this into a plain inexpensive porch light i got at oshworks well
it does do a false trip when headlight from a car shines at it which doesnt bother me
if people are bothered by this they shouldnt get in their carsthe photo cell is a nice feature keeping the unit off during daylight hourson my shed i had two separate motion detector flood light fixtures
i wanted both to come on when letting my dogs out at night since they lit both side and rear areas of my yard but the rear one would not trip unless it saw enough motion in front of it which was generally seldom
so i wired this one into the side of the shed after replacing it with a standard lamp holder and wired the second lamp holder to the rear of the shed with it
now both fixtures light as soon as you step off the deck lighting the whole yard upreplaces the old sensor for my outside garage driveway lightcould not get these here for some reasononly expensive commercial versionsactually i think they are better than the sensors i bought  that came with the lights
my original zenith sensors became erratic after  years outside here in colorado
also those sensors were the dual brite type a feature i never liked or used
this new sensor seems more solidly built  heavier and well sealed against weather
to replace the sensor i removed the entire light from the fixture box unscrewed the sensor from the plate and cut the  color coded wires
then i matched the colors of the new sensor to the wires i just cut black  black  white  white and brown  red
my sensor came with a brown wire not a red wire as the match to the red wire of the light
i used simple insulated crimp connectors  available at any big box store possibly even walmartthen installation was the reverse of removal
before you put the light back on the fixture box align and aim the lights and sensor as best you can its easier to do it at the work bench than up on a ladder
one small drawback my lights are white and the sensor brown so its a mismatch in color
i would have ordered a white but did not see one offered
its does not bother me but someone concerned with exterior color matching might want a white sensori replaced my old outside motion sensor with this
it fit perfectly where the old one was works great and looks goodi havent hooked it up yet so cant really say a lot about it except it was a great price for what i wanted it for lights  alarmthis is a great model for the price
amazon price is much better than most
it has the minimal functional controls but more controls would mean a higer cost and more prone to failure
buy  because the things do not last for ever outsidei had ordered this along with two  watt led flood lights
the lights came right away but waited over two weeks for the sensor
so i purchased a  heathzenith different model locally
i wouldnt work
this one finally arrived and it works greatbought as a replacement for an old unit that hung up at times leaving the lights on after sunrise
despite some warnings it works well with a few watts of led lamps for loadhad to replace the motion sensor on my old unit
old unit was about  years old
nice to still find this
hd and lowes wants you to replace the whole uniti needed to move my existing primary phone with message recorder into the room i use all the time i am a semiinvalid
this was an easy inexpensive fast way to do this
we ran the cord along the baseboard and held it with those velcro easy removal sticky strips
it is great and removes the necessity of going into a room that is chockfull of barriers for my scooter just to retrieve messages on the rare occasions i have to leave the house
it was done just a few days after buying this cord since it arrived only a couple days later
amazon to the rescue againthough it is longer than i needed it works perfectly
no shorts or wire noise
both ends seem well affixed to wirei bought this to use with the xantrex pro sine inverterxantrex technologies prosine  prosine  to watt power inverterbecause behind the  screws on the front controllcd display panel there exists a simple modular plug to extend the panel  feet from the inverter
i never even ran phone traffic over the cord
but it worked great for extending the circuit between the control panel and the inverter  the lcd still shows the data display and the onoff switch still works normally even with the inverter  feet from its normally built in controller
for the price i could not be happier  it came fast and solved a complex problem with very little money spentalot of things use modular jacks in audio telephone key systems etc
just be sure the number of wires matches there are  versions of this plug  the  wireuncommon the  wirecommon inc this one and the  wireuncommon but used in alarm systems quite a bitwhen remodeling a modular extension may allow you to move your alarm keypad to the other side of a new door or have some other feature panel that uses a  wire modular plug movedbeware some extensions reverse the wires  eg
the rightmost wire on the plug is now the leftmost on the jack  while this will work with phones it wont work on gear meant to use straight through wired plugjack extensions
ie
using an ohm meter you should see the leftmost contact on the plug makes a nearly  ohm connection with the leftmost contact on the jack and not to any other wires in the jackgreat accessory for phones toosimple extention cable i needed to run to get phone service to the other room in my house
works as it shouldi needed this wire to extend the phone wire to the jack and what a great job it did
it sounds like the jack is  feet away
no quality issues at alldymo is probably the only product ill ever usethe king of labels
you cant go wrong with the besteasy to load system anyone can use itthis labeling tape is pretty good and it is darn near impossible to screw it up drop it into the label machine type up your labels have it print then peel off the backing and apply
i actually love these labels vs what i have used in the past as it is truly a print peel and stick type of label with no mess and crisp professionallooking fonts
this tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labelsto top everything else off as i type this review i saved a little over  as the price i paid on amazon was  vs  for the same exact roll at the office depot down the streetthis is a good consumable product to make labels with prints good and is stickya good value and works well with the rhino label maker i havei mostly use this tape outdoors because this one does not seem to fade much outdoors and has great adhesive
the other plastic tape i tried black on white doesnt seem to have good adhesivei personally dont see any problem with this product
it is easy to put in a new cartrige and to take on out
however the cartridges do seem a little expensive but they last pretty long
ive never had one jam yet eitheri got this as a refill for my labeler
this is the kind of tape i always buy
it works well and i also have it in other colors
they have a variety
good priceworked as intended and would buy again
had no issues with these at all and i like how there are multiple styles of labels to usei had the labelmaker and the paper labels
they washed right off of the kids lunch containers
when i bought the laminted ones they are still on months later
they arrived in perfect condition and earlier than expected
thank youthis and the label maker is my best friend
i love labeling everything
from school supplies to putting my name and number on my expensive electronics just in case it gets stolen
not only are these great for everything in the house or office but amazon is also the cheapest place you can get these
walmart has them at a higher price
also if youre a prime member these ship prime if you have more than  dollars in your cart
i can not emphasize enough get refills
if youre like me i use this daily and go through these like water
you wont regret thesei mean what can you really say about it
its labeling tape
but looks good very sticky and definitely better then the paper kind
the paper gets dirty quick this plastic stays cleani purchased them when i purchased the label maker and they all came in the same package
im glad i did that now i have refillsblack letters on white background are clear dense and sharp
despite the the complaints of other reviewers i have not had problems with print quality sticking to smooth surfaces glass spice bottles metal surfaces etc
you cant beat the price with amazon prime under  to your door in two days
dymo has always been the gold standard in label machines since i was in elementary school in the early s and we had the manual label embosser machine
very pleasedthis was  more at office max with tax and i would have to spend  in gas to get there
got the same item for less and free delivery with amazon prime
i use these labels on everything including kegs of homebrew beer
the labels stay on even if the keg sweats but peel off when i need to refill the kegbought this for my dymo label maker
the price is much cheap than at local office stores
the tape has split backing which helps with aligning itthe product is exactly what i ordered and works with my label maker even though it is a older modeli really love the dymo label and they are  the price as through local merchants
you get two for the price of one
ai use this and the black on white mostly and have never had any trouble with this product
it works in my dymo and is cost effective
recommendedi bought the dymo label maker a couple years ago and couldnt figure out why it would print only the bottom of each character
i changed the batteries and checked to see that the labeling tape was in correctly without a change in the printing
after reading some reviews i thought it was possible that my labeling tape was just bad  ordered a new one  and now have perfect little labelsdymo labelling tape for a dymo label maker
what could be simpler
fits properly prints well and has plenty of tapewell its labeling tape
it works great and the backing material is split so its easy to get it offeasy to use fast really trasnparent and the ink doesnt smear or smudge in it
easy to peel fold it in halfthese are just what i was looking for and they work really well for labeling items
mostly theyre durable and dont seem to fade over time as others do
try them i think that youll  like  themmy label maker ran out ions ago and had been sitting in a drawer in my desk
i discovered it again and looked on amazon for replacement label tape
great price and shipped quicklyit is the only label tape we order and use
it is always a great product so we highly recommend for usemy girl has a label machine and loves using it
these are quality replacement rolls
i would recommend to anyonei use labels on nearly everything to keep myself organized
the clear ones are for items that a colored label would stick out on and i dont want it to
these are on mostly clear boxes that i still need to see through without the labels getting in the way
i have most of the colors on these but i seem to use the clear a lot more than othersi have the dymo letra tag label maker and i love it
i have one at work and one at home
excellent purchase for being the organized person that i ami purchased this here on amazon becuase of the ease of ordering and price both of which are great
this tape is also great  sticks to various surfaces even some rough surfaces have hammered finish cabinets that they stuck to
recommended for your dymo label makerfits the label printer well and labels print and stick well to a variety of surfaces
good price point to always have extra rolls on handthis is dymo labeling tape as described
it seems to work just fine
i would buy this dymo labeling tape againi use them to label my spray bottlesboxes and many others things and they have yet to fall off
perfect so far and only  changei first started using the paper labels on my collectible magazinecomics  i was so impressed after  years they have yet to peel offi only which the rolls would  be longer maybe  feetremember the old stiff plastic labels that were embossed by the label making machine
these are nothing like those
the labels produced with this tape are nice and thin and look professionali like this tape to use for items that are easy to recognize across the way
not quite as bright as it could be still better than standard whitei am a label freak
these are the plastic ones
black lettering on white background
they resist moisture
use this when you need moisture protectionthis dymo letratag labeling tape is perfect for making the black text stand out
if i use one of the larger fonts on my letratag label maker i can see the type from across the room
that is very handy to identify items or if an item is on a shelf where it might otherwise be difficult to viewi like the background because there are not many packages or other items that have this shade as their background
that makes these labels standout
they are easy to identify as something i have labeled
in addition i label everything from the contents of a cabinet shelf to boxes and bins i do not want to open prelabel i would have opened a bin  times to determine its contents  no longer to file folders to the back of all my electronics in case i lose one
that is just the tip of the icebergthese labels are easy to apply the rear of each labels backing is split in two so it is effortless
if i need to trim a label i peel away the backing first and then use a pair of scissors to trim up without the backing
i found that if i kept trimming the labels with the backing on i could not find the split on the back of my labels trimmed
since cutting most labels is quick and easy trimming with the back off does not deter from the adhesiveness of the labeli have had no problem with these dymo labels adhering to any surface
moreover the labels hold firmly in place regardless of temperature variations
i use a lot of this letratag tape and i have found amazons price to be the best
on all variations of the letratag tape their price is always the lowestthis label reel fits exactly into our dymo label maker
i highly recommend this item
it is a direct manufacturers replacementbetter than the solid white ones
and it prints better and adheres to surfaces better as well
if it doesnt print well its usually your batteries are weak sauceproduct was as offered
speedy delivery
these label cartrages work perfect in my dymo lectratag label gun
great product for the price
would highly recommend this product to a friendthese labels are extremely useful and durable the only drawback is length of tape when youre working on printing out quite a few labelsi label everything that needs it in my reference guides so i run out often during my studiesthe quality and adhesive is top notchi would recommend this product to anyone looking for labeling ideashope that helps you with your purchasing decisionthanks for readingit is what it is what can i say they work
the only brand that will workin the labelerthe labeling tape was just like the others i have used
needed it for a school project and it was perfectwhile label maker from dymo is frustrating far from my satisfaction as it ceased working as soon as arrived this tape works well with other label maker im current usinggreat product
worked great for my scrapbook project
wish i could have afforded more
there needs to be a sale and less on the shippingthese are the same carded dymo white plastic refill tapes that you buy at the stores for a lot less moneyfirst off tivo and replay are both great products
i wont go into whats great about them but when i was buying them i couldnt find a good review to tell me which is better replay or tivo
when i got replaytv i was a  little concerned because i read some bad things about it as compared to  tivo
the main reason i got it over tivo is because it doesnt have that  ball and chain  a month charge tivo has which adds up to  a year
the bad things i heard about replay were a loud fan which i couldnt hear  at all really
if i turned everything off i heard a small tiny relaxing  hum but i couldnt really tell if it was coming from my cable box or the  replaytv and someone said that the replay box calls long distance on his  phonei had the option of  to  local numbers in my area
some people  also said that the software on tivo is better i dont really know but  replay updated their software and it will download the latest version of  their software for you free
also they say the remote is a better on tivo
i really liked the remote on the  i didnt even need the instruction  manual to figure it out and tivo doesnt have the sec commerical skip  which is very useful
as far as features and software record time and  quality i think they are both about equal each have their strong points  and the differences are not noticable
i personally think that replay has  better features
but with replaytv your not stuck with that ball and chain   monthly billso if your choosing between the  i say buy replaytvtivo is the greatest
i was skeptical at first not even being a huge television watcher myself and now just try to take my tivo away
the things i love about tivo are  ease of use you can record programs at the  touch of a button on the tivo remote there are no tapes crouching on the  floor in front of the tv difficult settings etc
it literally takes a  few seconds to set the tivo to record an entire season worth of shows with  the season pass feature
maximizing your viewing time i record the  shows i like to watch when i have the time to watch them
that means no  more coming home and surfing channels and settling on something justokay
i get to watch my favorite shows when i have time to watch them
i can  also zip right through commercials with the fast forward button
the  onscreen tv guide is another great feature you can always find out what  will be on or when a show will be over without messing around trying to  find the tv guide
unlike a vcr you can watch things you have previously  recorded while recording another show
i set the tivo up myself and the  actual hardware hookup took me about  minutes
tivo comes with every  possible connector you could need i think so there was no running to  radio shack to pick up a coax cable or what have you
i had no problems  programming the remote to my television or making the setup call etc
it  was very easy to do
i highly recommend this product
it is well worth the  pricein the past twenty years ive purchased thousands of dollars worth of av and pc equipment
at  plus  per month for the programming tivo is my favorite
ok if i want to spend hours every week programming my vcr  of which i own five i can record all my favorite shows but why bother  when tivo does a much better job virtually automatically
since i  purchased tivo in april i havent recorded anything on the vcrs
i still  use them occasionally to play a rental movie not available on dvd
for  those of you that may complain about the month or  one time  charge for the programming data service i would suggest that this is a  minor cost compared to what you are probably paying for cable or direct tv  and i would submit that the tivo service will greatly enhance your ability  to utilize and manage the  to  channels that are available with cable  or satellitedo i watch alot more tv than i did before
not really but  now i always have something to watch that im interested in rather than  just watching what happens to be currently broadcasteddid i consider  replay
yes also a nice product but for my needs tivo is better
will  the price drop by christmas
probably but at  why wait
enjoy it  todayi received a great birthday present in  the tivo
i can honestly say its changed the way i view television however corny their ad slogan isi set up my tivo in late september and i havent looked back since
the setup took an extraordinary amount of time at least  hours but once i got rolling everything else was pretty easy
i cant tell you how much i enjoy taking my time to do things instead of rushing home to catch my favorite program
i dont have to worry because tivos got me coverednot only has the tivo recorded programs i like to watch but it recommends show that i might watch though the use of the thumbs upthumbs down recommendations i give to specific shows and i can say that some of the recommendations theyve given have hit the nail right on the head
the recommendations can be a little weird though
i mean im a guy who likes the simpsons but does that mean ill like rugrats as wellthis is not a perfect unit though
drawbacks include missing recording cues although not entirely tivos fault but youd think some networks would get on the ball here and standardize when they start and stop a show
you wouldnt know how many times ive said quotoh the recording started late againquot or quotwhy did you cut off the ending
quot also the unit in a quiet room can be a little noisy
when im watching a show late at night i can hear the units hard drive churning
maybe im nitpicking but i thought you would like to knowanother drawback is the inability to totally skip over commercials
you can fast forward sure
you have to be good at timing the fast forward right so that when you hit play youll catch the show just after commercialyes the product has drawbacks but i can look past that for now and say that this product is amazing
in a couple of years my tune might change but for now make mine tivoare you like me and tired of watching  minutes of commercials every  hourthen you will love this product
how valuable is your time
how  much time do you waste watching commercials
if you could cut that out  what could you do with that extra timehit pause and whatever you are  watching is digitally recorded
go make a sandwich and pick up where you  left off jump ahead of commercialsthis unit is smart
want instant  replay
its got it
want to preselect programs to watch
it can
want  to give a program thumbs down and have it remember you dont like it
it  can
want  hours of record capabiltyit has itbuy this recorder
you will never regret it
it will change the way you watch tv
it makes  vcrs look prehistoricthere are plenty of gadgets that give the impression that its great but once the initial excitement wears off you realize it didnt live up to what you expected
do you have pieces of junk in your closet that you had high hopes for
rest assured tivo is not one of thosetivo really does change the way you watch tv
not only can you pause quotlivequot tv a feature that has to be used to be appreciated but you can replay and slowmo live too
no more quotwhat did he sayquot or quotdid i just see that
with a simple push of one button you can jump back  seconds and keep jumping back  seconds with multiple button pushesand who doesnt love to skip the commercials
best of all for many tivo users the concept of quotlive tvquot simply disappears
tivo is after all a recording device
if you want to watch programs when its convenient for you its as simple as keying in a few letters to find the show and select quotrecord this showquot
best of all you can also choose a quotseason passquot which records that show every time its on that channel
no more missed episodes no more forgetting to watch
its a very userfriendly and easy to use device even someone who has a vcr with a blinking quotquot will be watching every show they loveupdate  tivo has added a quotwish listquot that will allow you to put in favorite actors names keywords or whatever you like so tivo can automatically record these personal favs
i put in quotbeatlesquot so now every program description that mentions the fab four automatically gets recorded for me
brilliantvideo quality ranges from subvhs quotbasicquot to nearly impossible to tell from the original quotbestquot plus two levels in the middle
i was worried with the claims that tivo quotdegradesquot the picture quality of recorded and live tv because of the mpeg compression but i found that the quotbestquot quality is nearly perfect and quothighquot quality is very acceptable
this videophile has no problems with what tivo does to the signalone of the coolest features of tivo is its ability to learn what you like and dont like
using the quotthumbs upquot and quotthumbs downquot buttons on the remote your personal tv player will be able to give you suggestions on things you might have missed or didnt know you would like
if theres room on the hard drive it will even record things it thinks you might like but only if you tell tivo you want this feature
i have found a few movies that i had never heard of that were actually pretty goodspeaking of the remote the philips tivo remote can also operate your tv and stereo receiver and its one of the best remotes ive ever had the pleasure to useso why didnt i give tivo a perfect  stars
i subtracted a star because with a device like this theres always room for improvement
setup takes an agonizingly long time especially if you have a lot of channels on your cable or satellite
the current version of software does not allow you to add quothandlesquot to your recording so its not uncommon to miss the final minute of a show or movie
update this and other great features have been added as a software update so my review went from  to  stars
if the network doesnt start at the top or bottom of the hour the recording can be less reliable and if something like sports run over causes a time shift you are out of luck for that recording
its still much much better than vhs recording of courseone thing to keep in mind is the claims of quot hourquot and quot hourquot tivos are a little misleading those times refer to quotbasicquot quality
if you care about picture quality you will be recording at the quothighquot and quotbestquot video level which can bring a  hour unit down to  hours and a  hour unit down to around  hours
record a couple movies at quotbestquot and you will start to see the hard drive space disappear
my advice go for the quot hourquot if you can afford it
once you discover all the great shows you have been missing because they arent on when you can watch them you will need every bit of hard drive spaceanother thing to remember is that in order to utilize your tivo to its fullest potential you will need to plug it into a phone line and subscribe to tivos  a month service
but let me say that the service it worth it
for that monthly fee they update the show listings every day and will even update the units software when they add new features
and tivos customer support is nd to nonefinal word tivo is a brilliant device that once you try it out in your own home you will never want to be without
if you value your time and enjoy tv this fun and friendly little device will become your best friendive owned my tivo for a month now and couldnt imagine not having it
ive completely stopped using my vcrs to record tv
in the past month ive change my cable service over to digital and reconfiguring the tivo  system was a snap
this is the best electronics purchase ive ever madetivos claim that theyll change the way you watch tv is completely true
being able to pause or replay whatever youre currently watching to grab a snack answer a call etc
is great
you cant imagine how helpful it is  to have almost two weeks of programming information available to pick and  chose what to record for the next few daysid recommend the hr unit  over the hr if you can afford it
after you start searching the two week  guide by program name channel name favorite channels or by time of day  youll quickly find plenty of things you want to recorddirectv viewers  will especially find this usefulit makes all those channels much more  manageable and i prefer the tivo onscreen guide to the one my dss box  providedall of the tivo menus are well thought out attractive and  very easy to use
they include lots of cables  including svideo a  phone jack splitter nice touch and other goodies so almost anyone will  find everything they need to hook tivo up right out of the box
the users  guide is helpful too for people who are a little less sure of themselves  around stuff like thisi picked tivo over replaytv because of their  close alliance with directv directv has invested in them and from  reading other peoples comments in newsgroups and other forums
after i  spent about half an hour going through the program guide and giving various  programs thumbs up or thumbs down ratings one of the cooler features  of tivo it came up with a whole bunch of other programs it suggested i  might likeim probably sounding like a company spokesperson but im  not im just a very happy new user of tivoi started out about a year or so ago with a  hour tivo unit and loved it
the problem was they lie about capacity sort of
 hours or in the case of the  hour unit are really more like  hours and  hours with the recorder set to record at best quality  anything lower and the picture looks bad
i then paid tivo to send me a new unit that had been upgraded to  hours then that was still not enough time with the system set at best qualityi finally found out i could upgrade the thing myself so my recomendation is to get the cheapest on that you can and upgrade it
this voids you tivo warrenty but hey we all like to live on the edge right i now have a  hour tivo because the company i used to upgrade my tivo  added an gb disk and now instead of having to delete my recordings early or being more picky about what i record i can go nuts and record anything and everything
i even saw on one website  a guy who has a  hour tivoanother good website for tivo upgrade information is   they have parts for sale and directions on how to upgrade your tivo the easiest is a  hour unit since you just add a quotblessedquot drivehappy tivoing and hack awayps if you cant tell i love this thingi agree with all of the glowing reviews here on amazon
this product has changed my television watching habits forever
having only owned this model for a few weeks i am already amazed at the changenow i can watch what i want to watch when i want to watch it and i never have to deal with programming a vcr againin fact i unhooked my vcr from my systemamendment to this review my tivo automatically downloaded and installed its newest software making a great product even better if you can imagine
my favorite new feature is the ability to have your tivo search out and record pograms by a very sophisticated set of search criteria
amazingi am amazed that more people dont own this product
tivo is the next thing after the vcr once it catches on everyone will want itbasically tivo is a really smart vcr
you watch tv and use the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons on the remote to tell tivo what shows you like and dont like
tivo uses these suggestions and an internal tv guide that it downloads everyday to figure out what shows you might like to watch
tivo uses all this info to determine shows that you might like and records themtivo also has features to manually record and a season pass feature
the season pass is a feature where you tell tivo the name of a show and then tivo automatically records this show anytime it is on
tivo is always on  so it never misses a showbeyond these features tivo also lets you pause live tv do instant replays of live tv and a ton of other featureswow i wrote this almost  years ago and i still love tivo but have graduated to two hd models
ive used several dvrs rented by my cable company and they dont hold a candle to tivo the only advantage is they are a little less expensive
but you get what you pay for
i still say get a tivo
theres not much one can add to  other reviews about tivo
all i can say is if you dont have one you dont know what youre missing
deciding whether or not to buy a personal tv recorder which is what they  are called is a nobrainer
buy one
the only decision is  whether to buy tivo versons sold by phillips and sony or replaytv sold  by panasonicboth systems require that they call in by local  telephone call each night to download program information about the  channels you receive locally either by cable satellite dishdirectv or  antenna and both charge for that service
replaytv sells for about   more than tivo because the replaytv subscription charge is included in the  purchase price
tivo sells for about  less but you must buy the  subscription
the total cost is essentially the sameone advantage to  tivo that replaytv doesnt offer is that you can also elect to subscribe  to tivo by the month  or year  if you dont want to shell out up  front the  for the lifeofthetivo subscription
replaytv  subscriptions are for machine life only
both lifetime subscriptions are  tranferable to new owners so you can sell it or give it to your kids when  the next ptvr generation comes alongeach consumer will have to make  up his or her own mind about which system to buy but i urge you not be  misled by explanations saying replaytv subscriptions are free  and tivo subscriptions are more costly
not trueno matter which ptvr  you get your tv life will never be the same
youll wonder how you  survived withouti hesitated before buying a tivo because i wasnt sure if it was the best option for me
now i cant believe that i ever lived without it
ive only had it for a month but now whenever i watch tv somewhere without tivo i get so frustrated because i cant pause rewind have an instant replay etc
i cant imagine living without the tivo i hardly ever use my vcr anymoresetting up the tivo is not as easy as they make it out to be  if you have cable box you may have to spend countless hours fiddling around behind your tv before you can get the tivo to work because its meant to work with either direct tv or a satellite
nevertheless it does work with almost all tvs and setups and after you first get it all set up its effortless to use
the interactive menu is intuitive and easytouse so youll be setting up season passes to record your favorite shows as soon as you start
you can search for shows to record by time channel name or genre and you can get a quotseason passquot in order to record the show whenever its oni love always having a selection of shows i like ready for me to watch instead of having to channel surf endlessly to find something
though there may not be a full  hours of recording time on the tivo  hours is only with quotbasicquot subpar quality picture and best quality you can only record  hours i still find that i always have extra room left over to record my favorite shows
ive actually found that i dont watch more tv now that i have the tivo i just watch tv shows that i actually like at times when i am available
i get more homework done now no joke
if there is extra room available the tivo actually records tv shows that it quotthinksquot that you would like since you are able to rate tv shows and movies it can choose similar ones that you might enjoy
for example if you give quotfriendsquot  thumbs up it may record quotseinfeldquot for you if you have extra room
if you dont want the shows it it records you can simply delete them or give them a quotthumbs downquot rating
the more shows you rate the better tivo understands your personal tastes
the only thing i wish it could do is record on one channel while i watch another but it is understandable that it cannot
also tivo comes up with quotupdatesquot now and again to improve on its features so if something isnt perfect now it may be improved in the future
for example some reviewers complained that while recording sports tivo would fail to record if the game went into overtime but now tivo has a feature which lets you quotcushionquot your recordings by however much time you want to ensure that you dont miss anythingone of the best features by far is a the quotlive tv guidequot  if you just press the quotlive tv guidequot button while watching tv a menu pops up on top of the screen giving the name of the show or movie a brief plot summary who the actors are when it started when it ends and whats on after it
watching tv was never so easy
whenever i show my friends how tivo works they are amazed by how we can pause go get a drink or go to the bathroom then come back and fast forward through all the commercials
youll also never have to say quotwait
what happened
i missed itquot because you can simply rewind backwards in the program and watch it againi know that i am gushing about this but tivo seriosly has changed the way i watch tv as many other reviewers have said tivo lets you control your tv not the other way around
i think that ill be using it for a long long time from now and i have no regrets about buying iti am an early adopter of tivo and it has completely changed the way that i watch tv
im glad that people are finally catching on to what ive been saying for over a year which is  tivo is the coolest thing ever
the main thing that i hear from people when i try to explain the benefits of owning a tivo is quotbut i have a vcr  why would i want thisquot  i have put together a brief list of the benefits of owning a tivo for you nonbelievers
i too own a vcr
and with all the good intentions in the world of taping programs that i wanted to see  i never did
arent you sick of missing your favorite tv shows
with tivo you will never miss your favorite shows again  in addition my little tivo friend may help you find new favorite shows
dont you hate commercials as much as the next guy
with tivo you will never be forced to sit through another minute of those crappy commercials
you will not even know what people are talking about as they discuss the new bud commercialyoull merely shake your head and know that those poor unfortunate souls dont have a tivo at home
dont you ever have to go to the bathroom in the middle of watching something
i wont elaborate on that one  but wouldnt it be nice to pause your tv to jump up and answer the phone grab a snack etc without having to worry about what youre going to miss
youll rent less movies
which also means that youll save more money
forget renting
just pay for the premium channels that you were always to cheap to pay for before because you figured that youd never watch that many movies
now you can watch them allso to sum up my little tivo review  i have to say that you will completely streamline the way you watch tv when you get a tivo
stop torturing yourself with the networks schedule that doesnt fit your schedule and make up your own
with tivo there is always something good onwhat you want to watchif you want to save significant time watching tv and want to watch a variety of higherquality shows when you want to this is the product to getthe quotpausequot feature is very handy but the big seller is the season pass below
if you have to put your child in bed you dont have to miss a part of your show  just hit pause and then play when you come back
same for the telephone or when mother nature calls
this is a great stress reducerseason passes are even better
no more fussing with tapes and figuring out which has what show on it not to mention that it would take  tapes to do what we do with tivo
for example we set a season pass for quotthe west wingquot just once and now it will record every show that comes up you also can choose only new shows instead of reruns
it will keep track of time changes and day changes
when you come home you look at now playing and it shows you what shows are available
ours has things like quotthe west wingquot quoterquot quotboston publicquot quotdavid lettermanquot and quotwhose line is it anywayquot
who cares when they were shown live we can watch when we want tomy wife watches soap operas again
with tapes she got tired of putting in new tapes accidentally recording over shows forgetting to rewind before recording etc
all of that is history
now the shows come up in the list and she can hit play or delete if she has several days worth she is more inclined to hit delete
while viewing she can skip through sections at x x or x
she typically watches  minutes in  minutes or less she only cares about one or two story lines in a showit will almost certainly change your viewing habits  for the better
you may watch shows again that you used to watch
you are not required to watch crappy shows because that is the only thing on at the moment
more shows higher quality less time
that is what makes a great consumer productboy do i love my tivo
ive had my tivo for over a year now and i hate watching live tv
tivo does an excellent job of finding the shows that im interested in watching and then saves them for me so i can watch them when its convenient for me
no vcr in the world could do it as easily and quickly as my tivo can
can your vcr search for shows starring a particular actor
how about movies by a particular director
can your vcr search the next two weeks of listings for shows that match key words you set up
noit cant
vcrs cant compare to tivoi dont watch more tv
i watch better tvafter reading about tivo and personal digital recorders in magazine reviews and here i decided i would take the plunge
i thought hard about getting the phillips  hour version but at twice the cost and because i hadnt even tried the concept out i decided to settle for the phillips  hour unit
after an easy but time consuming setup best if you do it right before bedtime i quickly realized how cool and useful this thing is
the video quality is fine decent even at the quotlesserquot levels movie credits do get blurry and difficult to read although true videophiles may find it unexceptional
i would have to say the most pleasing aspect of this is that i am now getting the most out of my premium cable movie channels
i am now catching a lot of movies i routinely missed because i was not vigilant enough to find out when they might be on so that i could set my vcr to tape them
now the quotnetwork showcasequot feature alerts me to all of the channels current and upcoming flicks and all i have to do is to say quotyeaquot or quotnayquot to recording them
even if i dont check ahead the thing records movies it thinks i might like based upon preferences i have expressed for other features and shows
awesome
also skipping commercials is an easy and pleasurable feature
by the way any football or other live action sports enthusiast easily will see the usefulness of such a deviceone thing that disturbs me about the tivo phenomena is that i fear that it may be rendered obsolete quickly because of how rapidly technology is evolving
i purchased the lifetime service option and i will be downright bummed if something else comes along to supplant it before i get my moneys worth and i wind up having to buy into something elsehonestly im pretty critical and particular about products
but ive had my tivo for over a year and havent watched live tv since getting it
why would i
with tivo when i turn on my tv i can choose from among watching programs i know i want to watch
i can jump over commercials
i can instant replay something ive missed
tivo even learns what i like and suggests other programs id probably enjoy  all while keeping my data confidentialim so keen on the product ive given two as gifts
weve had all sorts of gadgets in my home but none has taken over the way tivo has
my daughters  and  and my wife are complete converts
the tivo remote is the default for tv weve stopped using our vcr
its a killer productnext stop
im going to buy some tivo stock
travisthe philips tivo hdr personal tv receiver is a must have
for a first generation product it works extremely wellpause live tv to go to make a snack or let the dog out and when you return you can watch the entire  show right where you left off and not miss a thing since its still  recording whats airing livethe season pass feature makes recording the  shows simple and head ache free
dont worry about the networks moving  shows around since tivo will automatically find the change and still record  them for youtivo learns your favorites shows by your rating of them and  will record shows based on the profile it builds on you
dont worry this  is all done in the box and the information is not sent to tivo
so your  likes and dislikes remain privatetivo is very simple to hook up to your  tv and telephone line
it normally takes less than  minutes to hook up
you will have to program it upon the first use which will require a   hour call to a  number
you can leave tivo unattended once it starts
there after tivo will call a local or  number to update its listings  and content dailyin my experience tivos customer care is very good if  your tivo should develop a problemlistenyoure life will never be the same with tivo
i didnt convert until my two brothers kept recommending this product
now you can watch and record tivo shows at the same time
if you miss the beginningend  it doesnt matter  you can slew to whatever point in the recorded program
sounds inconsequential but it isnt when youve missed the beginning of the nightly news that all so important soap opera or whatever your fancy
one of the best features is the fast forwardrewind speed scan  once you hit play it plays back at the last visual pausetransition starting you at your programthe unit starts learning your tv preferences by content theres also a personal voting scale so the unit can start learning and recording on downtimes
this is great for reruns  but becomes troublesome to delete constantly if you record at high quality resolution or have a ton of shows lined up
also there a season pass that essentially records the specified show whenever it appears in the tv lineup this is a problem if youd like to override just one of the shows for an alternate specific show
youll just have to revert back to manual setting of timedate recording
oh the setting of timeday recording like vcrs is over you can search and select by show name search by type of subject matter drama news etcthe term product is misleading  this machine is a computer with onetwo hardrives a modem that allows for updates all the current input options satellite svideo rca and comes with all the cables youll need and more
the allknowing eye semantics on the front facia is a bit ominous but true to its function
get a unit with one harddrive if youve got the choiceresearch a bit and youll see why if youre a hacker
the folks who designed and put all this together should get some sort of couchpotato awardthat i dont know where to beginthe ui is very well designed
its obvious and intuitive how to navigate the menus
my only complaint is that i sometimes they err towards providing too many navigation and confirmation screens
while this makes each screen less intimidating it does make  navigation a bit more tedious
but this is really a minor complaint in an  overall brilliantly designed interfacethe features are explained well  enough in the amazon comparison guide and elsewhere
ill just say that  they work as advertised and are extremely cool
tv serves my schedule  instead of the oppositethe quality in the best mode the one used for  viewing and pausing live tv is nearly indistinguishable from the source
if you have a really big screen and high end audio equipment you may notice  the difference
i find it fine for general tv viewing though i do bypass it  for ppv movies
i generally use the medium second lowest out of four  quality setting when recording
its a lot better than vhs but is a  noticable dropoff from the originalmy biggest complaint is the boxs  sluggishness in changing channels and responding to user commands
it takes  about a second to change channels and sometimes several seconds to go  between menuguide screensthere are two misperceptions i constantly see  in user and professional reviews regarding tivo vs replaytv
first  replaytvs service isnt really free
they just build it into the base cost  of the unit
when factoring in lifetime service from tivo the prices have  remained comparable between the two products
tivo was a cheaper when the  products were first introduced and now replaytv is cheaper
but theyre in  the same ballparkthe second misconception regards tivos automatic  suggestions that are based on user preferences
wheres the negative in  this
if you dont like it you can turn it off and itll never record  anything you dont explicitely ask it to record
but whats the harm
if  theres extra space on the drive why not use it
itll never take space  away from the programs youve asked it to record
its hard enough to sift  through and find quality programming to watch
ill take any suggestions i  can get
the biggest problem with tv is too little quality programming at  the time i want to watch
the box is just trying to fill itself with stuff  i might want to watch
and sometimes it works
the other day i came home  and tivo had recorded the truman show
this is a movie i like but wouldnt  have thought to mark for recording
it was nice to have a good movie  waiting for me when i wanted to watch itevery time i turn on the tv  its like i have a little surprise waiting for me when i check what the  tivos recorded for me
i like the serendipity of channel surfing  of  finding something i wasnt expecting
thats why i like the tivos  suggestions in addition to it allowing me to specify exactly what i want to  recordi havent used a replaytv
its probably an excellent product  too but the number of technical complaints is troubling
tivo seems to  have a higher satisfactionlower complaint ratio
and tivos usage model is  more to my likingdont think of it as a vcr think of it as a personal broadcast network that only broadcasts the shows you like only when you want and without commercialsive had one since june and its rendered every other tv in  the house obsoletewith tivos current  off recommendation from  existing tivo owners through november its an especially good bargainany tivo is a huge improvement over regular televisionthis unit can easily be upgraded for more capacity
i added an additional  gig drive without a hitchpausing live television is great
i havent used my vcr in over a year
tapes are a joke in comparisoneasy onscreen menus guide the set up of recording preferencesthe season pass feature will record every episode for youok so it sounds like a digital vcr with a few bells and whistles and very limited capacitybut that true random access with the ability to switch around has drasticly changed the way i watch tveven before tivo  i tended to tape almost everything i watched
but with tivo this has become  so painless that i find myself almost never watching live tv
its so nice  to bounce around between the things i told tivo to record and the things it  thinks id like to watch
i can watch a piece of this a bit of that
skip  part of this delete that show i didnt really want to watchplus with  about  days schedule into the future i wont miss anything when out of  town for a weekonly serious flaws are the handling of conflicting  season passes and the limited storage  hours on medium quality
i  expect the software problems to be handled in a free upgrade in the next  few months and the storage to be upgradable in the field at selected  storesi already find it a pain to watch tv without tivoi bought the  hour tivo about a month ago
now i cant imagine watching tv without it
its so much better than a vcr
there are so many things i loke about tivo  you can start watching a program at the beginning even if tivos still recording it
the season pass   select a program once and it records it every time its on the choosen  channel
the ability to combine my local channels and the satellite  dish channels and see a program guide for all of them
now showing   its great choosing from a list of recorded programs instead of trying to  find the spot on the tape where a program begins
if youre watching  something that you havent asked tivo to record it still records the most  recent  minutes
so if you get distracted you can pick up where you  left off
the ability to record based on lots of selection criteria  show name channel time etc
someone else wrote that you cant go  back to the previous channel
but the quotenterquot button will take  you backtivos the best purchase ive made in a long time and i highly  recommend itthe new quotdigital vcrquot is a big step forward for tv
i only watch  shows a week if that
tivo lets me record these reliably watch them in a very easy manner and sadly has sucked me into watching even more  tvthere are some merits to both tivo and replaytv
but i will say  that for anyone who is not technical tivo is a handsdown winner
very  clean and easy interface
and techincal thought i am i prefer tivo as  well
my friends with replaytv agree that their relatives will prefer  tivoi wish amazom had the hour unit for sale and i am sure they  will but i have to buy a christmas gift and cant wait
amazon is listed  as a hour unit seller by the tivo website but amazon customer support  doesnt know when it will become availabletivo has promised an  upgrade plan for hour units but the plan is not in place and has no  pricing yet
they should correct this it has been the one sore point in  an otherwise exemplary pre and postsales support ssytem
i am sure it is  due to the rush to get hour units into the hands of new customers during  the holiday rushphilips has done a great job listening to customers
i  think they will continue to improve this unit most of which can be done  with software downloads in the middle of the night
support is very good  and the system works wellnotice this review relates to tivo not this specific hardware device
i have a sony satt directvtivo combination receivermy wife and i became addicted to tivo within  month after installing it
we have gone from watching  live tv recorded vcr to  tivo live tv
we hardly watch anything anymore at its regular time
we simply pull up the quotnow playingquot menu which lists all the shows i have previously recorded and watch whatever were in the mood for  drama law and order or once and again comedy friends south park reality tv survivor fear factor or sports illinois basketball cliff divingthere are so many cool things about tivo but these are my three favorite things season pass which once you set it up allows you to record a particular show every time its on or all shows with a particular actor or subject easy to record simply choose the show not the time and channel and easy to find and play scroll through quotnow playingquot list of prerecorded shows and choose quotselectquot to play record two shows at once like survivor and friends which both start at  on thursday with a directvtivo combination receiver which we havewe started with the monthly subscription and moved to the lifetime after just a month its good for the life of the box not you
we have a sony model and ive found sony to always be reliable two tvs one vcr
i bought a year warranty as a safety precaution new technology and insurance against the lifetime subscription
directv customer service is decent but not great they handle the tivo side as well
the best resource for tivo is the tivo avs forum which you can link to from the buzz section of the tivo web site
its a quotmust readquot prior to buying this unit
but i am not exaggerating when i say that this is the coolest most liberating invention to come out since the world wide web
no joke
you will fall in love with your tivo toothe philips tivo hdr personal tv receiver was super easy to hook up and setup
it takes only  minutes to make all the necessary connections
it does require a  hour set up which is mostly an automatic download of  the channel line up and programming datativo will completely change the  way you watch tv
it really does learn your likes and dislikes and it will  automatically suggest and record shows and movies that it thinks you will  enjoy
its really uncanny how it does pick shows and movies i enjoy
youll probably end up never flipping channels looking for something to  watch or watch quotlive tvquot ever again
just make sure you go for  the  hour model as the  will fill up very quicklytivo has been the  best first generation product i have ever owned
dont be afraid to take  the leap into personal tv as it is really very easy to use and the  recording quality is much better than with vcrsi bought tivo after seeing the infomercial on directvi had the satellite and cable subscriptions and was somewhat upset because i was always doing something when a program came on at its scheduled timenow  tivo grabs the shows for me and i watch when it is convenient for me
this  is a simple to use product
perfect for someone who likes the vcr but hates  buying and storing all those tapesthe user interface is easy to graspit is a little on the expensive side  but my free time is valuable too   and this product gives me so much time backyou wont be unhappy that  you bought thiswayne schulzweve been using this for over a year
it was an upgrade from a baset hub
the basetx feature was a significant improvement for home networking speed
we have three computers on it one an always on ftp server and this device handles the traffic flawlesslyif youre using internet connection sharing with computers with mixed nics some baset some baset you might see very minor improvements in internet speed on the computers with  cards but dont expect this to increase your cable internet speed dramatically
most of the cable networks are baset and only an upgrade to baset on their part would make a big difference
so when they say youll speed up your internet connection dont believe itwe tried a more expensive one a few months ago that promised improved performance   thought it might be better at handling traffic and collisions  but it made no difference
stick with cheap and reliable and this one fits the billi bought two of these hubs and i have connected them at a distance of about  feet apart
i completely upgraded my  computer  mbps system to  in about  an hour
also i upgraded in the middle of the day  while the network was running and with little interruption to the  workstations or the network
the only trouble i had was my own mistake
i couldnt get two of my computers nic to run at the faster  mbps speed  only to later find that the hubs had automatically sensed that the nics  were  mbps only
they work like a charm and so does my new fast networkthis has been my secound experience setting up a small home network
the first involved an smc router
the linksys documention and overall user experience setup guide admin screens and so forth put the smc materials to shame really its night and day
both routers seem to work fine though the smc unit conked out on me i think this was a fluke
but the linksys usability wins handsdown
highly recommendedive used my hub for various applications  cable modem splitting from a router and simple pcpc gaming
this hub is perfectly utilitarian for getting the data back and forth with high reliability and unparalleled speed
no problems autosensing in either situations over several months of usethough it does say  ports  if you use this as an uplink from the router youll obviously only get  output ports
this is not the case with the gaming issue though
the only minor complaint is the ac resistor power cable
the ac adapter plug is rather easy to yank out of the backside  especially if you are moving cables frequently
other than that its worth every cent for high speed fun and efficiencythis linksys switch is a basic network device that is used in home networks and large companies
it does what it is designed to do and does it well
there is no configuration and no set up just plug and play
i own several of these and i have never had to touch it after installing it onto my networkthere is a basic switch there is no port filtering no protocol filtering and no interference
some higher end switches come with those features but in the end they just end up slowing the network down unless they are higher end
anyone that requires those features should not consider this switch or any device in this price range
it will just slow your network down go with an enterprise solution from hp cisco or similarfor  of the home and small business users looking to buy this i recommend it highly
it professionals or network managers i would look at either a gigabit switch or something more advanced
on larger networks with  users if you install ten of these it will increase latency and decrease the speed of your network
i am an it manager and these are great for small singular uses but do not build or manage your networks with these types of devices
you are asking for trouble down the lineback to  of users this device is perfect for you
i feel obligated to share my more technical advice for the people in my profession that may purchase this switchi needed an additional hub or switch to run from my wireless dslcable router which only had  pcuplink port
this switch worked great and seemed to be priced comparable to many hubs which would have worked fine for me but obviously not given the benefits of the switchif you need to add a few more computers to your existing network this product is greatbought this switch to connect a couple of pcs and a wireless access point to my routermodem
performs exactly as a switch should in a small package and for a reasonable pricei bought this for use in a dorm room where i needed to turn one port into multiple ones for pc xbox  etc
this switch works great
i plugged it in and it worked right away
i have recommended this product to several friendsi replaced an old hub on my home network with this
i was getting an lot of collisions and slow performance
this unit cleared that up
cant beat the pricethe linksys ezxsw etherfast  port workgroup switch is a fairly simple device that allows for the easy expansion of your existing networkthis switch connects to your router and gives you an extra ports to connect other devices to the network
the devices can all have different duplexspeed settings and they will work finethis switch is very inexpensive costing about the same as a simple hub
it was simple to set up taking less than  minutes and has never given me any problemshighly recommendedthis is a very useful product for those people who have more devices than they do network jacks
it works and its inexpensive
as more and more networkcapable consumer electronic products come out the greater the need will be for devices like thesei am currently using this product to share a single network jack between a windows pc and a macintosh pro
speed is much more than sufficient
your internet connection speed will be the bottleneck in most cases not your home networkone thing to keep in mind though is that not all devices will work if you have this switch between the device and your office networks switchhub
i could not get the ip telephone at work to function through this switch
however the computers have no trouble under the same conditions
i confess that i am not knowledgeable when it comes to ip phones thoughthis is a very handy device
i highly recommend itjust to be clear this is a switch and not a router
search online for the difference between a switch and a router to learn more
i wanted to share the internet access from my cable modem with my computer and my new internet capable bluray player
well i found out the hard way that this switch will not do the trick
if you already have a wired or wireless router between your cable modem and your computer then you can use a switch like this to connect more computers
it just gives you more ports but it does not convert ip addresses to the outside world which is what you need when you want to access the internet from multiple network devicesi bought a router from best buy for  but you can of course also buy them on amazon
they are a little bit more expensive then a simple switchanyway just wanted to let everyone know
otherwise i guess it works just finei have had an aging mbps linksys hub as the core of my small home network for several years
even though i was happy with it i bought one of these primarily because it was cheap and thought having a spare couldnt hurti had no idea how much that aging piece of equipment was slowing down my network
almost everything i have now is  so dropping in this switch made my whole network a heck of a lot faster
furthermore as a switch as opposed to a hub it is much more efficient with the use of the network  traffic isnt broadcast everywhere only to the nodes that need iti am very happy with this purchase
cheap fast and dropin simple installation to my existing network
i decided to purchase another as a spare and donate my older hub to historyi decided to go with an ethernet home network because of its speed and secutity
i had a cable running through the attic to another room where i had a computer attached to the network
i needed to add another computer in that room to the single cable and was not sure how best to proceedafter doing some research on the web which included learning the difference between a hub and a switch i discovered the switch should do the job i needed done
i plugged the ethernet cable from the router into port one and a desktop into port  and the laptop into port  it all connected and worked properly once i had set up the laptop to connect to the network
it is now working perfectly and the switch is invisible to the network but is quietly doing its jobi am using the linksys router and switch and they are doing the job i needed done
i am completely satisfied with the producti combined this switch with thelinksys dualband wirelessn gaming adapterto extend my wireless network to wired devices located in a room other than the one that contains my router
this switch gives me extra ports to connect my slingbox ooma bluray player and television to my home networkinternet
since the device is so simple theres very little that can go wrong with itpotential buyers should consider how many devices they want to connect and then add one or two ports for future devices
six months ago i never would have expected to need one ethernet port let alone four in my family room with changes in technology you may need to upgrade to a larger workgroup switch sooner than you expect
if you are only worried about bluray and one or two game consoles then this switch should be adequate both now and in the near futureproducts that can be connected to this switchooma core voip phone system with no monthly phone service billssling media slingbox prohd sbplaystation  gbsamsung bdp p bluray playersony bravia wseries kdlw inch p hz lcd hdtvand many more debbie lee wesselmanni pulled it out of the box  plugged it into a router port and added my two printers didnt even have to configure the one printer easy add device for the other printer
switches are tiny now and it was so easy
its hidden and i dont plan on touching it for years
the specialty router costs  and a port went bad
 is a lot cheaper
thank you for extending the portsi bought this switch when my home network started to grow and was not able to accommodate all the new devices that i was adding to it
several of those devices do have wireless capabilities but i felt much better with having them directly connected to the ethernet through the oldfashioned wired way
this is both for security reasons as well as for the sake of reliability the speed of connection
a full additional router for that purpose would be unnecessary and much of an overkill and this switch seemed like a perfect solution
when i got it i was at first surprised with how small it was  it is hardly larger than a deck of cards
the small size belies its performance since it worked perfectly and impeccably form the very moment i had it set up
i have been using it for about half a year now and have not had any performance or other issues with it
its small size is a bonus since it doesnt add to the electronic clutter at home
the front lights give you an indication of the working status of several network features
overall i have been extremely satisfied with it and for the price there is probably no better switch on the market right nowwas adding a network printer and needed more connectivity
prior experience with linksys gear influenced the decision
the switch is compact and does all that was expectedthis was a quick easy way to give me the extra slots on my network i needed
it was as easy as plugging it in and connecting to the existing router and then hooking up whatever devices i needed to add to it
works greati had been using a linksys router for a few years before buying this switch
then i changed to a new dsl provider frontiernet whose modem is also a router so i picked up this switch to split my connection to various computers in my home having two routers on frontiernet caused problems with tcp port forwarding
first i was surprised by the compact size of the switch
i hooked it up and it was good to go  a slick connection and no messing around
it is a perfect companion to the speedstream  dsl modem and probably many othersinstallation was a snap
i wanted to connect a couple of things to the internet in my living room so i bought this switch
plugged in my dvr receiver a ps and and iptv stb all to it
no setup or configuring at all
just plugged in and boom instant internet to everythingworked great no problem did the job it was need for
cant say much else
i have no dislikes about itwith this device i can connect my pc and xbox  at the same time
i was able to purchase this for less than  dollars
the speed on gaming is better then with my previous device
allinall one of the better investments ive madenice little box
it tucks away in the corner
i am using it to extend the ports on my dsl router
the fact that it has an uplink port is helpful
no extra cable to buyi got this in the mail yesterday opened it up connected my ethernet cables plugged it in and i was instantly hooked up to my interneti got this so i wouldnt have to swap out the ethernet cable between my  and ps when i wanted to play online personal choice to keep wired over wireless bc i think performance is better wired
so i got this and as described above i set it up and it works flawlessly
both connected right away to the internet and i can have both connected and downloading stuff at the same time should i wanthighly recommendedupdate oct  im not sure the item currently pictured is the product that we purchased and review way back whenoriginal review from the only thing i can say about this product is that i ordered it and gave the box to a coworker who ran out of ethernet ports in the wall
needed to plug in  devices and only had two wall ports
about  minutes later he came back and said it works
exactly what i wanted to hear
plug in and useuse this in my dorm room to allow multiple connections to run from one internet port works great on the xbox  pc and multiple laptops with no latency slowingthis switch does exactly what i needed it to
it is small and easy to set up
ethernet cable goes in and five more come out
the ac plug is not a huge strip hoging brick
it took zero configuration to get it to work perfectlyi have a long ethernet cable that runs from the cable modemrouter in the atic to my computer in my den
i plug that cable into this switch and then two cables come out to my computer and printer
now everything is networked with my wireless devices
it is exactly what i wanted
i might even get a networked hard drive now that i have the switch in my denthe price on amazon is really good too
i was going to buy this used on ebay but found it here for just a few bucks more brand newit has been running for a few weeks and i have not had any problems with it whatsoevera productthis switch is much smaller than it looks in the picture
i expected it to be the same size as my linksys routers so i could stack them but no such luck
switch performs welli already had one of these behind a netgear router and recently added a second to accommodate some gaming systems and a new pc
the older switch is over a year old and has held up wonderfully with moves a few drops on the floor and signal drops from the cable modem in front of everything
no issues great product and i would definitely recommend all at a great low price toothis little switch is a great buy for the money a lot of features in a little package
if you need  more ports this is a great buyi bought this when my network router went on the blink
since i had a dsl modem with a firewall i didnt need another router and this product allowed me to connect  computers to the switch
installation took about  minutes and i noticed an increase in speed right away
i recommend this product to someone that doesnt need a firewallthis little baby is just hook up my desktop wireless ap wired router togetherit just works nothing elsetips if youd like to use overseas buy nokia ac adaptor autovolt model it just works with nokia phone chargerthats all no question askedgreat switch and worksi have only minimal knowledge about networks
all i wanted was my tivo box to connect to my computer upstairs via a network cable with an extra port provided by the switch downstairs for a computer to act as a media center to control stored tv programs and movies
i briefly read the manual online to see which outlet was the upstream outlet plugged in the cables and the box worked without any need to reboot the tivo or alter any setting on the modem router or switchnetwork has been stable since setting it up and problem freenetwork is comprised of linksyscisco broadband router a linksyscisco wireless hub which is connected to the switch via a cable since the wireless link would not stay stable to permit a whole program to transfer via tivo desktopif you want a solid  port switch for your home network dont look any further
linksys makes a quality product and you will be very happy with your purchaseusing this for my home network of   mbps linksys in win machines plus a  mbps linux machine
works fine
there is no software driver required for this drivers are required and supplied with the nic cards that go in your machine
looks really cute sitting on the shelf with the blinking leds
hope to use it when eventually get dsl or cable internet access out herethis was very easy to setup just plug it in and it works
i bought it to put in my room so i could split my ethernet to run to my desktop pc gaming consoles and even a laptop if for some reason i couldnt use wirelesssmall nice worked the first time unplugged the hub in with the switch  full duplex and it worksi have a couple of these linksys switches alresdy
i needed a couple more and found the best price here
i use linksys for all my network needsi plugged in my workgroup switch and then plugged in my ps my dell gaming computer and my dell laptop and everything worked just right
hard to improve on this thing for trouble free installation and operation and the previous reviews were what guided me to select iti use dozens of these at my work when there is just one wall jack and i need to connect several pieces of equipment
note this is just a dumb switch and not a routeri bought this switch for the various devices in my rv
its small uses little power and does what its supposed to do transparently
it also stacks using optional stacking bracket with my linksys wireless bridge and router and cell phone router
with this setup i can get wireless at campgrounds when available and easily switch to the cell phone network when its notdish network works seamlessly with this system so i can order ppv without a phone line
my sons xbox can reach xbox live
this switch is the heart of my rv networkworks as described and no complaints
i am using this for my tv blu ray player and xbox off of my linksys router
just make sure you hook everything up in the right order according to the directions on the cd and you will have no problems
i would recommend linksys to anyonethe employee it was ordered for has been using it for awhile
seems to be working greati used this switch to simply add internet conncection to my xbox alongside my pci live in a college dorm with only one ethernet wall jack for my use so i bought this switch and it works just fine
excellent speed and overall perfomancethis product came in early and only took me a few minutes to set up and begin using
my wife notices the speed of using this over the wireless in our home uverse wifi so she is very happy
will do business with this seller again
thanks dont hesitate to get this
small plug and play  and for me it has worked for about a year with no problemsworks how its supposed to
only complaint is that it has poor documentation and could be unclear how to set it upi was confused about the difference between hubs switches and routers
i just wanted to take the ethernet connection from my cable modem and split it to three other computers so that i could have a faster direct connection since i have somewhat spotty wireless connection due to interference with neighbors routers
this switch did just the charm and was surprisingly inexpensiveso if you have a modem with an ethernet out and want to connect multiple computers to the internet this device will work for youcisco makes networking easy because their products just work right out of the box
i got exactly that with this switch which allowed me to plug in several networking devices with one ethernet source
i have this dasiychained to the big port hub and everything works like a dream with issues and no setup time at allthis product has served me just fine
i have experienced no problems with this switch and i am certainly glad that i got this because i have a computer on mb instead of mb and i would not want that one computer to slow all the others down
it seems a little overpriced for what it does but as a product its performance has been optimalrunning out of ports since i like wired wherever i can for better connectivity
worked exactly as i needed and gave me  additional portsgreat price and it does what a hub should do
i have had multiple versions of this switch and all work well with my home networking needs for netflix and slingbox
i recommend itthis product performs as described
i have no complaints
i bought it to use multiple computers from my internet connection using wired connections
so far its worked flawlesslythis switch works fine and does what its supposed to do
the one i received is all black and there is another listing for it on amazoni dont get the negatives ive read here
someone said it gets hot
well where are you keeping it
its a simple little digital switch that doesnt create any heatmaybe a slight watmthanother said something about it being cheap plastic junk
its actually a very good quality piece of equipment at a very good price
i guess if its not a huge heavy expensive thing they perceive it as being cheapthere was also a complaint about cutomer service
ill admit i have not had to call linksys cutomer service for years but the  or  times i have they are the best
imagine actually getting a human person on the phone and walking you through everything you needbottom line qulity product
good price
i wish i needed more of these little thingsthere almost fun to buy and plug all your gadgets inand oh yeah very easy and simple plug and play installationok
for those that insist that nothing is perfect my only design change would be  to eliminate some of the indicator lighting on the front
there are about  little lights on there
my office area already looked like christmas at night with all of the leds shining off of everything from my computer to the phone to the clock and everything else
now there are many more colorful lightswhat else do you need to know
you plug in your pcs and a cable to your router  and go
i used a netgear hub for years
replaced it with this linksys switch and my network speed improved immediatelythis is a simple commodity product that works fine
tiny complaint is that the cables come out of the front of the box would be better if they attached at the backthis switch does exactly what its designed for sharing an ethernet connnection
dont expect to be able to configure vlans multilayer switching vlan trunks load balancing etc
this does not have any routing nat or firewall capabilities
you would use this switch when you already have a router between your internal network and the internet and you need additional ethernet ports
this gives you a full duplex ethernet connection at wired speed and it delivers
perfect for the home officelan or for technicians needing extra etherenet ports for their workbench as this is what i use mine for
thanks for reading
hope this helpsi bought this little switch because my home network has expended a bit recently
i had been using  port netgear wireless router to hook up everything and had already ran a wire to the basement of my house for the xbox  when i added another computer in the basement i needed to be able to run an ethernet cable to it but didnt want to run another cable to the basement
i bought this and hooked up the computer and the  i can use both at the same time and it doesnt effect the rest of my network upstairs
i still can connect the  as a media center extender and stream music from any of my connected computers
in summary this switch works exactly like i expectedive noticed quite a few comments related to the size difference between ciscos compact and standard series finally a problem with a simple and cheap solution
linksys sells a pack of very versatile plastic mounting plates that not only allows you to mount components vertically on the wall or you can stack them
when stacking the compact to the standard you will notice the form has places for the feet of either series on each side so you can mix and match as you see fit
the box comes with a load of these more than i cant imagine anyone including your netties finding a use for all of them but the small expense offsets any concern about leftoversthe linksys description and part number for a box of these are wall mount and stacking bracket mo
no
sm the color could be described as deep grey or charcoal  very handy very cheap either tough polymer or plastic and very simpleas for the linksys switch above i have two and both installed easily and operate trouble free
this switch compares favorably with slightly less expensive dlinks desktop switch
im no expert but i dont see much difference between the two with the execption of dlinks missing uplink port tied into the eigth port
both are plug and playnow back to my own network madnessqqqq
  axi wanted to replace my old port switch where i had my motorola cable modem my server and my linksys wireless router
worked great as soon as i hooked upsmaller than the switch i had and design and color match my wrtgwanted this model and amazon got the best price
cant complainbought this after i ran out of ports on my wireless router
plugged it in and works great
cant ask for morei have always used linksys products and very good reliability from them
this is no exception as soon as i applied power and hooked up all my devices the unit performed without incidenti work in technology and have for the last  years
there are two products that i have that really impressed me tivo  linksys routerswitchwhat it takes for me to actually be impressed by a technology product it has to be simple plug and play simple the right price or better and be  reliable or betterthis product is simple just plug the darn thing in and it works
you only need to configure it if you want to do something a little nonstandardit has yet to fail me and i have had it for quite some timeif you need to share a high speed internet connection like dsl or cable this product is the best i have seen
also in its latest incarnation it supports pppoe so it will work with any dsl provider out there without having to install the crummy isp software on your actual workstationoh yeah and dont forget it supports nat network address translation so it basically acts as a firewall as wellserves its purpose 
quick and easy setup very little to no knowledge required to setup
highly recommended for home usei was able to make my home hitech with the addition of my access point and this  point hub
now all the rooms in my home are adequately hooked up and are up and running with the internet
im very pleased with this purchasethis is a great little box for connecting a small network without breaking your bankthe ezxsw has a great worksize ratio
its small enough to set on top of a computer case and provides eight ports of full duplex  networkingit has a very informative display to give out info for connection speed duplex connection and collision
the setup is as simple as plugging in the power and network cables
i have yet to run into any problems with this unit and would recommend it without a second thoughtcisco bought linksys a while back  smart move
cant get any easier  works great while it is smaller than the linksys router it still sits nicely on top although feet pattern does not matchif youre considering buying this switch you most likely have more than a few computers to network
and if youre the casual home user this switch will give you appreciable performance at a great price
as a geek with  constantlyon computers with a mixed os network i can say that this switch which was an upgrade from a port  hub really improved my network connectionsfirst off you should know the difference between hubs and switches
hubs are your typical central connecting device that will allow you to hook up more than one computer on to the network at a time
they are usually quite cheaper than switches at the price of loss of performance
switches have separate bandwidths for each port unlike hubs thus allowing more traffic to go through between each computer on your network
of course if youre going to be doing nothing but sending emails and occasional web surfing a cheap hub will do all of this for you
but for the heavy gamers or those that want to use network intensive tools will appreciate the individual bandwidth that each port getssome people complain that by switching to this switch their network performance has decreased
this was the case with one of my computers where transfer rates sharply fell from  capacity to  in a matter of seconds rendering a gb file transfer practically impossible
after a bit of analysis i found  causes for this  faulty cabling and  cheap unreliable network adapter
if you have cheap old network cables that have been crushed by chairs doors etc they could be affecting the reliability of your network and the full duplex operations of the mbit network could be adversly affected by line conditions to where it has to resend packets to correct transmission errors
the other common culprits are cheaply constructed network adapters nics with especially poorly written drivers
i replaced all wiring with mhz cat e cabling and replaced all cheap cards eg cnet pro  with higher grade ones and the reliability and transfer rates have soared to a little under theoretical maximum throughputs
according to a network expert some recommended lowercost cards are dlink dfetx uses the rtl  chipset or com etherlink or tx seriestoo many people blame the switch when it is really their setups fault and it should be pointed out that the switch is very wellmade and easy to setup
it should be pointed out that the switch does make an electric fuzz noise that many switcheshubs will generate
if you are using quiet computers or laptops or are planning on putting the switch anywhere quiet you might find the noise distracting
however its a subtle quiet sound so the level may vary depending on your perception of loudness
also if you have more than  computers it should be noted that these switches are not stackable so you it wont be as neat
wall mounting is possible and probably recommended as a small lightweight device such as this tends to not stay on the ground very well if the angles at which you plug in the network cables lifts or pulls on itthere arent any true flaws in the product works and performs well and i readily recommend it to anyone seeking to setup or improve a home network on a budgetplugandplay with my existing network which is comprised of wire router netgear switch and this linksys switch
they all play well together
im happy with this purchaseoverall im very pleased with this workgroup switch
the speeds are just as good as being connected directly to the modem
the only thing worth noting is that the device i received is colored different
instead of being blue and black the one i received was all black
as i said this made no material difference the device has worked properly for over  years now
very satisfieda perfect switch for my home network
ive been using it for months
it is cascaded off my  port router when my network expanded
works flawlessly
you just plug into your network and your up and running
my network consists of a netgear router feeding this switch which in turn feeds a wireless access point
my only complaint is that i should have bought the  port unit as this one is fullnetwork novices should remember that an  port switch is really only a  port switch as the th port is shared with the wan uplink
at least this switch has the separate uplink portthe ciscolinksys ezxsw etherfast  port workgroup switch does exactly what it is advertised to do   ports plug it in and it works great
it doesnt get any better than this
i could whine  it doesnt stack without a mount on my wrtgl
i solved this by not stacking itawesome product  i ordered this because my  port router was more than full
plugged the switch into the router then into the wall and it was done
very easy no setups no firmwares simple
one thing you should be aware of im not going to rate the products itself less because of this is that the next generation models are out
its the same thing but they are considerably smaller than the previous version
amazon should really update there picture
i have this stacked on top of my linksys wireless router and it does fit but it does not lay in the four corners and previous linksys products
not a big deal and still looks fine but just a heads up
 starsfirst off would like to state that i love linksys devices
it was shipped to me rather quickly and when i opened the box it was a total different product
now i dont mean different product as in it wasnt a linksys
it was in fact a linksys but it wasnt blue and black like i thought it was and models ive seen in the past
it in fact was an all black model
to be honest i was really glad about that because most of my networking products other linksys devices are all blacki run my xbox through this along with a wireless access point which is a linksys as welli needed to add more devices in my office and this switch worked well
very easy to setup and useamazon does not give its  day price guarantee on this item because it is sold by a company other than amazon watch out when you buy from amazonive had a linksys gigabit switch for a few years and was never really pleased with it
recently it started acting up and finally gave out completelyi bought this  because it was cheap
i was a bit worried because it wasnt gigabit but it works fine
a network expert would probably tell me that a gigabit switch was surplus to requirements for home use
a  that works is infinitely better than a  that doesnt worki use this for streaming  roku  xs wdtv sonos hopper
actually the hopper is sort of a reverse streaming thing
it has a slingbox on iti had a problem with one i was using and decided to get this one
works right out of the box because its a switch no config
is needed
i would buy another oneworks as advertised
mine has been working well since i bought it
i have it in a network with one other linksys switch a linksys router and a dozen devicesthe form factor was not exactly as shown in the picture with the large linksys stackable legs which would have been nice as i have all linksys stackable routers and waps
rather it is the exact same unit without the large stackable legs
i can still stack it and the smaller legs do interlock with other like units which i have alsoi prefer to stack components rather then have them sit side by side all over the place and a lot of the new form factors are stand alone facing up or standing on their side made to be the only allinone componet for the average home user
if your network is more extensive with several waps and switches along with your router stacking saves space and just looks betterbut either way for  it was a great deal
i have found linksys products to be very reliable
i have a router two waps and two switches all linksys products that all work greatthe linksys  port workgroup switch was just what i was looking fori used this product to wire our small library to  computers and wireless access
it works greati got this router for my entertainment system
now a tv avreceiver media player brd player game console all need connections that is  i did not go with a gigabit router since streaming and even gaming in general does not require that much bandwidththe only problem i had was around connect the cat cable
i am not a network specialist and frankly it took me forever to figure out that the uplink should not be used in this setting
so use port  and steer away from the  uplink part
that is apparently needed for your router but not for extending the wired networkhad a previous version that was destroyed due to power surge and replaced it as simple as plugging in the power cord and the cablesan easy reliable means to add ethernet ports to the typical port routerhub
who ever thought  ports would be enough
a whole lot easier than daisychaining routersthis is the second linksys switch i have owned
the first one served well for around ten years and was a casualty in a recent move
when i needed more wired connections i looked around but these are still the best for the sub price rangecisco recently sold linksys to belkin which concerns me
i figured it would take some time for the manufacturing to go downhill i despise belkin and have never had a good experience with them and i was right
this switch does not disappointsome people swear by wireless but you cannot beat the speed and security of a wired connection
i highly recommend this product and assuming belkin doesnt taint the product line would buy another one if my current one got crushed like my last one didtake it out of the box dont confuse yourself with the user guide provided its  useless and no quick setup guide use the ezxsw quick set up avail on linksys site if you have to
or just power it up plug it in install patch cable to link it to your network in my case the router plug in those extra cables you have been swapping around on the  ports on the router and youre ready to goim new to high speed internet
when a cable modem was installed this past saturday i had no ethernet card so usb was required
i was very happy with the connection even though the download speed was falling quite short of the claims made by our local cable providerbut no matter this was such a vast improvement over k that it just didnt seem to matterone day later i found out about the att callvantage service which allows you to have phone service via a high speed modem
price was very attractive but one probleman ethernet card was required for hookup
that was the reason for purchasing the lnetxim still waiting for the callvantage equipment but in the meantime the money spent on this card may be the best money ive ever spentdownload speeds increased dramatically once this card was installed compared to usb
 kbsec speeds were being experienced with the usb connection on a fairly recent intel motherboard
they immediately zoomed to  kbsec using the lnetx
repeated tests of the download speed have yielded similar results so im confident that this upsurge can be attributed solely to the lnetxinstallation was quickeasy and the price was right
im very pleased and surfing the internet is fun once moreid like to tell you that it is better than a lot of other cards out there but i dont think it is
when trouble shooting my network i decided to return another ethernet card made by another manufacturer and see if that was my problem
since i was using a linksys router cable dsl hub i thought it could be part of it
not it performed the same
my performance problem turned out to be norton internet security which was only installed on that machine
nothing to do with the hardwareall in all this card is a very nice piece of equipment
it couldnt install any easier
booted down with your power plug removed you install it in an available pci slot
when rebooting it asks for the driver which is located on the included cd
it loads and your off to the races
no configuring
just smooth performancehighly recommended
linksys has been only good to mea good quality network card for setting up a home network
i have  of these cards and have never had a problem with any of them
i also use the linksys port switch to connect them all and share the internet with my dsl modem
these network cards are rugged and reliable and an exceptional value for the pricehave used this companys products many times
this item is performing as i would expect it to do
linksys continues to have some of the best networking hardware available
i commend amazon for making linksys products available to its customersdont you just love when plug n play really works the way that it is supposed to
it took all of two minutes to pop this reliable performer into my winxp machine
xp immediately recognized it upon bootup  i didnt even need to use the driver cd that came with the cardperformance since then has been exactly what i expected with no hiccupspros  true plugnplay setup  hasslefree configuration and solid performance  price  under  with the current manufacturers rebatecons  linksys registration requires the serial number which is only on the card itself  write it down before installationi bought this little fella while it was on sale andwith a  rebate
it was practically freeim running windows  on a older dell dimensionp wmb ramthe installation of the card was very very easy
theinstructions with the unit were very clear
i amtechnosavvy but i still though the text and the supportingcolor pictures were greatthe software installation on window s was a snap
ididnt even need the support disk
windows k recognizedthe card and installed it all for mei love plugnplaylinksys is a reputable company linksyshas a great website as well
i bought this product forthe name recognition and price
ive had it installed fora few months and have had nothing but great successpicked this up at a local store and glad i didnt pay more for another brand
i got it for my dad whos finally going dsl
installation was a breeze in his win system
the package already comes with the latest drivers for the various flavors of win and win and if you use winxp the os already has the drive for this card builtin so its pure plugnplay
just install the card in a pci slot turn on your computer and maybe install the driver depending on the os version and you are all set
compatible with dsl and cable modems
this is one excellent value
theres a wire for the wakeonlan feature
i dont have a lan so dont know if it actually worksi bought like a dozen of these cards ranging from version  to version  and all of them work very well in my lani will recommend them to my friends and continue to buy them for my desktop pcs
they slap in and install perfectly wo any problems
ive never had one fail or run erraticallystrong buyi had no trouble installing this card in my windows  server
i  connected my cable modem to it and success came quick and easy
it has been  in use for several months without any problem
great product great price
i also have one of these in my windows nt computer on this network  where  it is also working fine
cheers if you dont realize that pci stands for programmable computer interface then you are the kind of goober who shouldnt be doing his own upgrades
otherwise you can work out any potential problem with this card just fine
i put two in some windows me machines and the driver software wasnt on the floppies that came with them so i went to their website and downloaded them installed them and was fine
they are performing flawlessly with my linksys hub for cable modem and two other disimilar systems with different cards and computer set ups
i see no reason to pay the  com price for a ethernet cardand i think  com is now in troubleim extremely pleased with this product
i purchased it to get away from using the usb connection for my cable internet connection
on usb the computer would hang quite frequently
ive not experienced any hangs since installation of this cardinstallation went smoothly very impressed with its performancefor some reason the ethernet port on my mobo would not show up so i purchased this to hard wire my router into my dsl modem
this was done trying to get the magicjack to work it did not help
one good thing did happen though my onboard ethernet port showed up and alls good with that now
this board is doing as good as can be expectedi have  linksys cards in my home network
the price was right and they have worked without a hitch
installation was as easy as any network card under windows  se
compatible with my via and ali chipset motherboards
use with their  port hub or switch hub with uplink portthe card arrived securely packed
easy to follow instructions and it works greati dropped this card into my dell tower which has partitions for fedora core  linux the one i use most and windows me only used when i have to
it worked great
so i put another one into my wifes quantum which runs nt  installation took a little more fiddling but the card worked flawlessly after id found the right driver
its inexpensive and it does everything we need for home networkingif you want a quality network lan computer card by an excellent company this is itno problems worked under  nt k and linux tuliplinksys is a leader in networking for good reason
i first got this card because of my new cable internet connection
even if you are a novice computer user with no experience in computer hardware you can install this card youself
the directions are very good with step by step instructions that are easy to read for anyone
once you have it installed the driver instructions are also easy to read and offer them for any operating system you can think of
if you are running windows xp or thinking of upgrading you dont even need to install the drivers yourself because they are built into windowsxp and it will install itself making instulation that much easier
they also have a nice webpage that further explains troubleshooting if you get into a problem for some reason
dont go pay some store  bucks to install a network card you can do it yourself in  mintues for nothing and linksys makes it possible at a very good pricealso after having the card installed for over a year it has never gave me any problems whatsoever
i wish i could say that about some other hardware that i have purchasedthis card is easy to install and itll work right after you install the driver and restart your system   sedont fall with the inexpensivenic go with bus mastering itll make you happyiomega zip  mb usb external drivethis unit has a rounded dark blue case and is powered by the usb port
you should select the icon to unplug or eject hardware to remove this device
the iomega software should be installed on windows  if the unit does not have an eject button on the drive you must select the eject command from the properties menu
it is good to do this all the time because of the disk caching system
the  mb drives can read and write to  mb zip disks but slower than with a  mb disk
the fastest transfer is with an internal ide zip devicethe users manual warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega copy machine program
right click on the zip drive to select the iomega format function
use short format to delete all data on an iomega disk
the long format repairs a drive with errors converts from another format or removes all passwords not usable on a mb disk
write protection protects against writing over data a password can protect against both reading and writing files
you can also flag the zip drive as nonremovable so it appears like a hard drive
the manual has the detailscomputers have a limited number of ide devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical
replaceable  mb zip disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology
the  mb zip disk is less widely used than the  mb disk
zip disks reuse deleted space unlike a cd whose space is consumed when you replace files
falling prices for cd discs solve that problem
a zip disk has no compatibility problems between different windows systems and computers
a cd written on one system may not be updated by different software on another system
you may find support on the internet for usb mass storage devices for win
to test the status of a used zip disk
 right click on the drive select properties
 select the iomega tab after support was installed
 select diagnostics then close after the green light
 select more info on the disk type note the disk life status and the format life status
percentages lower than about  are not good
 a long format can improve the life status statisticsi have over  years worth of files on zip disks and needed a new drive after my  year old drive died
i i get  years out of this one ill be more than happyi believe this is a better alternative to the usb drive and much better than a floppy disk drive
i have one at home in my desktop and another i use at work to backup important files
i dont have to worry about loosing it since it is big and it is very durablethanks to iomega for making such a great product
it worked easily with my toshiba laptopi bought my toshiba about  years ago
i wasnt sure my usb connection would be compatible with the iomega drive
but to my surprise it worked just finenow i can backup all my important laptop files and transfer digital photos from my laptop to my desktop easieri needed a way to access some old data i stored many years ago and this was a perfect solutionusing this was confusing at first but i quickly rectified the issuethere are two instances in which you will get a seriously annoying error trying to access the disk if a disk is bad if you click on the mounted drivefor   you are not supposed to click on the mounted drive as this is simply a reference to the fact that the drive has been mounted at all
there will be a second entry that pops up  that lists the volume label of the media you have inserted into that drive
please access it using that do not click on the mounted drive entry if you click on the volume label only to get an error this means your disk is bad
now a bad disk does not necessarily mean totally unaccessible just as a bad hard drive does not necessarily mean that eithersometimes a zip disk will access under one operating system but not another  when it is going bad
it also depends upon the file system you are using
if your zip disk is formatted in the fat  fat formats  all oses should read it fine
if it is in ntfs  only microsoft windows and unix linux etc distros which properly use the ntfs driver will be able to see it
if it is formatted under linux and you need to see this in microsoft windows  you will need to google for and download a utility called extfs
be warned  though they claim it works fine under vista it breaks hard under vista
xp and lower only please this is my third zip drive but my first mb and of course my first usb
the usb interface worked fine on my desktop win  but the installation also enabled the neverbefore usable usb port on my laptop win b
i  wasnt expecting this
i was going to buy the optional pcmcia interface   but this saves me the forty bucks
i didnt look at the transfer rate but  it seems even faster than my  mb internal zip atapi interface on one  of my puters
very fast
recommendedfor those who have zip discs with old info this is good from which to copyive got my zip usb running on a ghz pentium  with windows me and had no trouble getting it installed
have not had any system locks either
its much faster than my old zip  that ran on the parallel port though the usb reads zip  disks with no problem though slower than  disks
im using iomegas quik sync backup software and its great to have it operating automatically in the background without me having to remember to do itwhen i bought mine the usbpowered version was not yet available so mine uses an ac power adapter
the usbpowered version would be nice to have for running on my laptopthe zip   is perhaps the most rational choice for anyone looking to  bridge the gap between macintosh and windows based machines
in both the  scsi and usb forms it invites portability
its the ideal solution for  anyone who creates anything but video on one platform for use on the other
for crossplatform video editing a jaz drive is more  appropriate
its also great if youre living on a budget
though your  initial purchase is more expensive than buying a zip  youll spend far  less on disks
since mb disks are essentially the same price as mb  ones your overall storage costs will be cheaper in the long termperhaps more importantly you wont have to abandon your existing zip  library to upgrade
the products much vaunted backwards compatibility with  zip s is real and mostly trouble free
the only glitch with it is that  if youre trying to save large over mb files to a zip  it will take  substantiallyeven painfullylonger than if you were using a zip   drive
for many people this wont be a consideration
but if you have  large multimedia files in your mb disk library you might consider  transferring them over to mb disks
to put it simply i definitely  wouldnt recommend either version of this product  if you plan to use only  mb disks
the real question though  is whether you should get the  scsi or the usb version
out of the box the scsi external is twice as  fast as the usb but less portable
to use the scsi version youve got to  have scsi cards installed in every machine on which youre going to use the  drive
virtually no computers pc or mac come with preinstalled scsi  cards so youll immediately have to spend money to bring your computers  up to speed
and youll have to deal with the fact that most unknown  computers wont have a scsi cardmeanwhile the entirely more  portable usb version though slower by default can be brought up to the  same speed as the scsi
with the addition of a firewire adaptor theres  no difference between the two drives
all macs since the g and an  increasing number of pcs come with firewire builtin
and if you happen to  encounter a computer without firewire you can easily remove the adaptor  and go back to the default usb connectionwhich isnt exactly slow  anywaywith either form youre going to have to spend some more money  to get both top speeds and portability
if you dont plan to travel  outside computers you already know have scsi capability its probably  cheaper to go with a scsi zip
but if you want the fastest  largestcapacity  zip drive that you can use on the highest percentage of  computers buy a usb zip  and add on a firewire adaptoriomega zip  parallel port drivethis device allows both storage and transfer and works on any bidirectional or epp parallel port
for best results you should run the parallel port accelerator program when the unit is connected
computers have a limit on the number of ide devices and desktop computers have a limited number of bays
the disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the mb limit
this device must be connected when all power is off like a parallel port printer
backing up a small amount of data is not a problem but large amount of data files will run slowly
the fastest transfer is with an internal ide zip device
most printers will operate from the printer port on the back
the  mb unit can read and write the more popular mb disks as wellthe users manual warns against using the operating system to copy a disk
use the iomega copy machine program

it was my first zip drive which i dont have anymore
it was a very good drive and it lasted a long time
i now have a  mb zip drivenice little box
performed faultlessly the four or five years it was connected to my two ugly beige boxes
switched between windows and linux without failure
unobtrusive
what more could you askepilogue got rid of the two ugly beige boxes and retired this gadget but still give it full pointsi wanted to buy linksyss quotcompactquot kvm switch because i thought the case looked cooler and i wanted to be able to switch between pcs by pressing my ctrl key twice
however one of my two pcs uses a serial mouse and at keyboard so i had to get this one which includes one set of adapters instead because the quotcompactquot switch only supports ps mice and keyboards
much to my surprise it uses the same keyboard hotkey as the compact switch although i never saw that feature advertised anywhere
because of this i was able to drop the switch which really isnt very big at all behind my desk out of sight  i never have to touch it
if theres any degradation to my highresolution screens i cant tellgreat product and price
works as advertised
running an xp tower and a windows  tower
grab one while you can
i have a feeling a kvm switch will be hard to findi get the linksysy kvm and the first time it work great in a compaq proliat running windows  server and in compaq presario running linux red hat but when i restart the linux bos for th first time the mouse dint came back it was really crazy making stranges moves but i resolve the problem edint this two filesfile path etcxxfconfigi changed the section entitled quotsection quotpointerquotquot and the line below toprotocol quotimpsquotfile path etcxxfconfigi changed the section entitled quotsection quotinputdevicequotquot and the line below tooption quotprotocolquot quotimpsquotthis solved both the erratic mouse pointer problem and enabled scrollingive been using a kvm switch for over  years with a linux and windows box and i thought it was just the best way to go
ive gone thru two analog switches the ones with the tangle of wires inside and i bought a bunch of  cables
i originally bought cheap monitor cables but the ghosting was  terriblemy old system worked fine at x except occasionally it  would lose the keyboard but the fix was to simply reinsert the keyboard  plugi recently started working with a much larger monitor running  x under windows x under linux  and my old setup just  couldnt handle the video bandwidth the ghosting was terrible
so after  checking out the reviews here i thought id give this one a tryits  great
there might be a tiny bit of ghosting but its too hard to say if  its just the monitor itself
the only problem ive noticed is that i  cant get the mouse to work well under linuxx windows
for some reason  the resolution of the mouse just isnt great so the motion is a bit jerky
but its a small problem albeit annoying
the keyboard toggle between pcs  works flawlessly and ive never lost the mouse or keyboard and the video is  always centered although thats probably a function of the monitorif  youre using two pcs or a laptop and a pc this product is worth its weight  in gold its very light as its sold state not the clunkly switch of old the cost effectiveness of this item is superioroccasionally the double tap of the ctrl button does not work but that is easily solved by pressing the button on the boxthe cables were of good quality and color coded for todays pcsonly drawback is that its not expandableits truei am a chronically unorganized person
my office is a mess my desk is a mess and my schedulewell we wont even talk about thatfortunately one aspect of my life has become a little easier to manage thanks to my brand spanking new palm vx
until recently i didnt really see the use in a pda but when others in my office began raving about theirs i took a leap of faith and bought a vxwhat is itessentially the palm vx is the high end noncolor organizer offered by palm
the vx is capable of managing your calendar email task list address book and offers a whole host of other capabilities through thirdparty softwarethe vx has a sleek silver aluminum case that offers more protection than the traditional plastic case
in addition the vx has a slim design that is nearly half the width of many of the other pdas on the markethow can it organize my lifefirst get rid of that bulky franklin planner
the vx can store everything you would typically store without all that paper mess
need to make a note
write it in the vxs notepad
need to check your schedule
check it out in the vxs scheduler
just about the only thing you cant do with a vx that you could do with a franklin is doodle and i probably just havent figured out how to do that yethow easy is it to install itinstalling the vx is relatively easy
just connect the cradle to a serial port on the back of your computer pop in the cd and run the setup
the palm desktop software setup walks you through the process in about  minutesbe careful however if you are going to use outlook for your email client
in order to use outlook you have to have the pocketmirror software installed it comes with the palm cd
when the setup asks you if want to setup your pda to read email click the button that says learn more about using microsoft outlook
this will setup the pocketmirror conduit and enable your vx to read and send email through outlook
well as i mentioned above you get sleek looking pda that replaces your traditional planner
on top of that however you get rechargeable nicad batteries which are a must for anyone who uses their pda a lot
theres nothing more irritating than to have your aa batteries die in the middle of a meetingalso you get a nice looking leather cover which i promptly replaced with a bodyglove neoprene cover for 
i wanted the extra protection and i liked the ability to hold business cards in my pda casewhat are the downsides
the first downside is lack of expandability
although you are able to connect a modem for mobile access i dont like the fact that you cant add more memory or modules such as mp players digital cameras or any of the other modules offered for the handspring
apparently palm realized that i was not the only person who feels this way because the new generation of palm pdas the m series offer memory expansion slots and additional modulesalthough it doesnt mater all that much to me i guess some would consider the lack of color to be a downside
although i did consider the palm iiic when looking at pdas i chose to go with the smaller lightweight model rather than the bulkier model that offered color
i dont miss having color so its not really that big of a downsidethe only other downside i see is the fact that the cradle shipped with the pda runs off a serial port instead of a usb
although i dont notice a big difference in the time it takes to sync i would like to know that as serial port becomes more outdated i can continue to use my pdaoveralli am really impressed with my vx
i have been using it for a couple of months now and have nothing but praise for it
the batteries hold their charge for quite a long time the sync process is relatively quick and the organizer itself has attracted a lot of commentsif you are considering a pda i would definitely take a look at the vx
its well worth the moneygreat little device it has helped organize my life tremendously
on top of that it scores the cool points
the only drawback is the price but that was easily outweighed by the sleek sturdy design and  mb of ramwhat can i say
the palm vx for the money is the best pda you can buy
it syncs flawlessly with my work wink laptop and my home desktop mac
its reliable the battery life is fantastic and with mb of ram i find it more than enough for all my games books and appsmy suggestion skip the palm  and save yourself the palm vx is everything the palm  is and maybe even more
who needs the secure expansion slot anywaytengo  meses de utilizar una palm vx mantengo toda la informacion de mi agenda diaria a la mano es muy confiable y rapida nunca he tenido problema de perdida de informacion o cualquier otro tipo de problemas
considero una muy buena eleccion comprarse unai bought my palm iiixe before this and had always complained about the size
it works great and all but i just want to have a little machine that i dont even feel it when i carry it aroundnow palm vx does exactly that
its slim sexy design is well worth the money
rechargable internal battery means you dont have to worry about changing batteries every month or so and can feel free to use the backlight
as for functions its basically the same as all palm iii series
 mb of ram palm os  things like that
youd probably be using the normal functions like calendar phone book notepad task list more often
for me i use it to read chinese books and have a list of important emails backed up on my palmweighing in at just oz it has the same anodized aluminum exterior and lcd screen as the palm vx handheld
yet it has four times the memory of its predecessor giving you more speed and more storage now no matter how busy your life gets you can keep it together in style keep all your meeting times places people phone numbers and other information safely tucked away in this elegant device mb of memory stores up to  addresses  years of appointments  todo items  memos  email messages plus theres plenty of room for extra addon applications books language translators image viewers dictionaries games advanced calculators and more use the hotsync cradle to quickly backup and exchange information between your pc and your palm handheld as well as any number of popular pims like symantec act

a great advancement in the realm of the palm pilot this unit is far more durable than the iii or the vii seriesthe money that i put down for my palm vx is some of the best ive ever spent
reallyprior to my palm vx i had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when i needed them most
as a result i often forgot to do things that needed to be done lost important phone numbers etcyou get the ideamy palm vx changed everything
now i keep everything important from the standard addresses to dos notes and appointments to my accounting info stock portfolio and local movie times thanks to avantgocom all on my palm vx and its greata warning to those buying palm vs though
it takes time to get used to it
i hated grafiti the quothandwritingquot you must use for the palm to recognize your input at first and found the miniscule onscreen keyboard a pain
additionally i saw no real point in keeping a to do list and all my appointments on the thing
after a month of forcing myself to do so however i was hooked
after really taking the time to get familiar with the thing i use it on the order of twenty times a dayfar more than ive used any other device digital or oldfashioned pen and paperso my buying advice buy one
palm vxs are absolutely fantastic really
theyre beautifully designed you wont feel geeky pulling one out
and the handiest things in the world
i promise
be sure to buy a hard case to keep it nicelast year i helped my cousin install his palm v to work with his desktop
thought it was a neat device but did not want to buy one for myself at the time thinking that my laptop was good enough for what i need to do
stupid decision i finally bought myself a palm vx this august and it has changed the way i use and access information on the move
its forte is dependable connectivity and it does that so well
the vx ships with chapura pocketmirror which an excellent syncconduit manager optimised for outlook users  and is a breeze to set up
pocketmirror integrates seamlessly with palms own desktop manager  just follow the instructions and you will be able to hotsync all your data in outlook literally within minutes
the vx also ships with avantgo which is perfect for those of you who want to browse your favourite websites offline and on the move it syncs with your chosen sites every time you hotsync just a push of a button awaythere is no point dwelling on the number of addresses memos etc
that the vx can store since these are pretty much the industry standard with other brands too and realistically it is unlikely that you will ever run out of space for these items
the mb in the vx comes in handy when you use applications such as avantgo and if you tend to keeps hundreds of messages in your outlook inbox like i do
i have recently added documents to go  a rd party addon
this software brings word and excel files into my vx and now i no longer have to use my laptop for every important document or spreadsheet i need to access quickly in a meeting or whilst on the phone  its all there in the palm of my hand pun intended if i had a palm wish i guess a colour version of the vx would be the ultimate though knowing the folks at palm this is probably around the corner since they have already released a colour version of the iii series  the iiic
i guess i would also like to have my sent items mailbox from outlook in my palm  there probably is software available somewhere on the net which does this but i havent found it as yetbottomline
spend the money on a palm vx you prospective pda shoppers 
you will not regret it i bought the palm vx as my first palm pilot and its worth every cent i paid for it
it may not have as many features as the new ones like a color screen expansion slot or bluetooth compatibility but its inexpensive and very reliable
its run downloaded applications smoothly and with no trouble
its got plenty of memory mb a rechargeable battery and is thin and light
its even better when you add accessories like the palm portable keyboard or the travel charger
if youre looking for a basic palm pilot for a surprisingly inexpensive price this is for youthe palm vx is a great pda for three reasonsfirst it is compatible with the wireless omnisky service which will allow to check time sensitive email and check to see if your flight is delayed
i am a road warrior so this is a big plus since it can let me know if i have time to relax a little longer before waiting around at the gate for the plane to permit boardingsecond it has a great form factor
for those of you who have never owned a pda before the form factor gets important over time
you may think that it isnt important but anyone who needs a pda needs it to be small
if this wasnt the case try lugging around a heavy laptop and you will know what i meanthird and perhaps the most important reason is that this is compatible with all palm applications
i know there are other pdas that are not palm but use the palm os such as handspring and the sony cle but some apps do not work unless you have a geniune palm
for example dinkypad doesnt scroll in handspring but it does so on an original palmalso when you buy a palm you can be sure that the upgrades to the os that palm releases will be compatiblethe only negative thing i have to say about the vx is that it doesnt go as fast as the handspring platinum or prism since they have the newer motorola processorif you begin to use this as an organizer  address and calender  it puts the dissheveld life in shape
but when start taking notes downloading databases restaurant and movies listings it changes everything
this becomes the friendly resource it should be  reminder of things and rememberer of others  what time does that store close
given the sync capabilities with webbased services  vindigo and avantgo  there not as much additional value in the vii
all movies listings are current most key phone numbers handy etc
the extra memory does come in handy as you enthusiasm baloons
i do recommend an additional case that is a little more protectivealright for those of you who know my reviews as few as there may bei am always as honest as physically possibleto begin lets start off with the style
its incredible
i picked up the palm hardcase yes yes i know it isnt all aluminumbut it looks nice and gives it more protection than it would have otherwise
this palm is a pure head turner compaired to their earlier models
small sleek and rechargable
i have owned this palm for over two years nownot a single problem with the rechargable battery
i was cautious about thisbut i get a nice charge from it and it lasts for quite a long amount of usepalm software is easy to use and easy to install
secondly the palm obviously runs palm os
to this day it has never given me any problems
no crashing or anything windowsce relatedthis unit has a bampw display and even though many of you probably would rather go with a color onethe pricetag is just too high
also i find the bampw display much easier on the eyes than the glaringbright color displaythe only bad thing that i can think of is the backlit display
simply put it is of no use unless you are in absolute darkness
this is a flaw that was fixed on the backlighting on the new m series and onso if your considering a palm pilot look to the palm vx
with  megs of storage space its plenty of room for ebooks gps systems or anything you can throw at it
id also recommend getting the writerights for this palmkeeps it staying like new and reduces any glare you may get off of the screen in brightglaring locations
i fully recommend this product to students and professionals alikei have recently bought a palm vx and i love it
compared to my old way of keeping track of all my appointments and contacts it is a godsend
it was  easy to install the software and the hardware taking no longer that   minutes
as for the palm handheld itself it is very easy to use
if care  to spend about  hour playing with it you dont even need the manual its  all very straightforward
the hotsync worked great with my microsoft  outlook
another feature of the vx is the rechargeable battery
although  this can be a great convenience it can also be a hindrance
if youre  traveling you have to take a charger
this is the only shortfall that i  see from this product
furthermore i would highly recommend this to  anyonei love my palm vx
i thought of buying the m but decided not to due to the cost and not currently being supported by omnisky wireless
i like the ms screen better than the palm vx but not enough to justify the extra 
as of now i didnt see any need for the expansion slots but im sure over time there will be a number of usefull extras that come on the expansion cardsoverall im pleased with the palm vx and would recommend it to anyonethis handheld is made with great quality
i myself had a palm m which has very similar stats
the palm vx is so much better made and the rechargible battery is awesome
i would recomend this to anybody who needs to get organized or just likes to play games in school or workgreat product
easy to use data transfers quickly from computer  nobrainer synch
rechargeable batteries have a very long life and recharged quickly making travel a breeze
handy combination rechargesynch cradle runs on v  suggested improvement would be to make this a combination v charger
the palm vx is a winneri thought it would be helpful to make another review  months after using my vx instead of a few days just to give a more objective perspective on the utility of the device once the novelty and the excitement of a new toy has passed awayhardware after  months i would have figured that palm or handspring or even sony would have come out with a pda that could rival the vxs elegance and style
unfortunately or fortunately depending on where youre standing none has come close
another pleasant surprise is the durability of my vx
although i cant speak for all vxs out there mine has survived quite horrific spillsthere are few hardware hitches with the vx but nothing that i would take away anything from its obvious beauty and durability
there is one other issue that i must address
initially i thought having a built in rechargeable lithium battery instead of the aaa batteries would be a clear advantage
however i have discovered that its not the case
for the vx to be that thin it had to adopt rechargeable lithium batteries
although one might think that a rechargeable battery is better than aaa you better be prepared to charge your palm at least every three dayssoftware no matter what the pocketpc boasts of its capabilities if it lacks third party application support then how useful can it really be
similar to windows ce or even the other pda operating systems the pocket pc could die a slow and painful death because of this lack of supportthis is the real strength of the palm os
 months ago there were thousands of third party applications with hundreds more being added monthlyunfortunately because of this flood of applications some applications may have unknown effects on our units
although many result to a soft resets there are instances when a hard reset complete data loss is required to fix the problem
sometimes there are instances when certain applications wont work with the presence of others
again these are unusual circumstances and it certainly wouldnt deter me from getting a palm os unit againoverall i guess by know youve guessed that im still in love with my vx
i have many applications on my palm but my personal favorites are for regular applications there are fireviewer and avantgo and documents to go for games there are dope wars v  irbattleship pacman spacetrader and yahdice and for utility programs there is atools benchmark hackmaster and cruisein terms of accessories i recommend getting the palm hardcase
check out my review on this product
there are hardier cases out there like rhinoskins and concept kitchens but this one is my favoritespeaking of concept kitchen i also recommend using their writeright product
its a protective film that goes over the screen
not only does it protect your palm screen from scratches and reduces glare it has a pen to paper feel when using a stylus
speaking of stylus you can just forget about the stock stylus of the palm
its 
if you want to get carpal tunnel in  minutes go for it
otherwise i recommend using another instrument
i recommend using those multipens that have a stylus pen and pencil in one
there are many great pens out there that have already incorporated styli in their line
cross makes one the is pen on one side and a stylus on the other
pilot makes some nice ones lamy and rotring makes them too
i personally use the rotring matte black triopen
its a converted pen so i had to buy a stylus refill and replaced the red pen option with the stylusunfortunately it hasnt been a completely smooth  months
just recently i had a strange experience of my address book being completely wiped out
it existed on my desktop but it wouldnt sync to my palm
after a little reinstallation of the desktop application and consultation with the palm technical support i was able to fix the problem
which brings me to the point of hotsyncing
it is critical that you hotsync
i must say that although it is not necessary to running your palm a computer is essential to back up files and to install programs
get backup buddy as well
that works really well
hotsync hotsync hotsync
the vx is a good investment
with the m and m soon to come out that should decrease its price considerably
although id be inclined to recommend the m the vxs price is a steallast thing before you go and buy your pda i strongly recommend you do your research
i cant stress it enough
read what people have to say about their experiences and thoughts about their units
consumers are the best sources of objective reviewsgood luck people and more power to palmive owned a few palm pilots over the past several years
i switched to the palm vx because my palm iii gave out after months of abuse riding in my back pocket
the vx is solidly built very reliable and never needs batteries
i use mine heavily and sometimes forget to recharge it in the cradle
ive found that the battery lasts about three weeks with heavy use as long as you dont use the backlight
i now use my palm vx with my laptop running windows  and synchronize my data using the infrared port
the cradle is just a charge stand for me
if youre nervous about buying this product relax
i teach computer skills to executives in the chicago area
the learning curve for palm devices is about  minutes
there is a shorthand called quotgraffitiquot that you will need to learn to write in your information but you can also use your computer or a separately available keyboard to enter in your data
newer and more powerful palm devices have been introduced since i bought mine but the vx is an excellent value now that the price has dropped
and its still the smallest
if youre looking for a pda to handle your personal and business information and do not need to display color photos videos or play mps the palm vx is perfecti have had my palm vx since late  i am still using it today june  i would love to now upgrade to a color palm
however i am very fearful that i will not find another pda which offers the durability and longevity ive received from my current palm
i will continue to use my palm vx until it dies  permanentlywith less and less time to remember dates times and special occasions the palm vx is a handy gadget
has a whopping  mb of memory which should be sufficient even with a ton of games  forgetting names numbers and addresses will be a fad of the past
there are tons of applications on the internet that you can download and use which help save time and make this already handy tool even more useful
you can also beam files and your business card to other pda users as well as laptop users via the fast infared port which allows for wireless transfers
great buyi bought my husband a palm in march as an early fathers day present and  after watching how it changed his life i decided to get one for  myselfthe palm organizes my life
im a parttime working mom and ive  got a zillion things to keep track of
the appointment book is great i can  set alarms for myself and make sure i dont forget the kids piano lesson or  that meeting with the school board
the address book keeps track of  everyone i need to and organizes them into various categories that i can  define personal business pta volunteers whatever
there is simply a  ton of shareware that can be downloaded from games for the kids to  professional productivity apps from spreadsheets to flat file databases  from medical billing codes to exercise schedule trackers
anything you can  think of is most likely availablethe part i like the best is not only  can i synch the palm with my own laptop including email and news websites  but i can also beam things back and forth with my husband
that way he  knows where im going to be and i know where hes going to be
no more  scribbled notes on the kitchen calendar for us
and the palm desktop  software can have multiusers so we can even synch to each others computer  if we like rather than beaming individual itemsall in all this little  piece of hardware is one of the best purchases ive made in years
the only  thing it needs is a case to hold a business card or two but those are  available all over for purchase from third parties
if youve been thinking  of getting one of these dont hesitate go for iti have owned both a palm vx and iiic my current model and they are great products
although i have had my iiic for almost a year and my vx for  months before that i am still just as amazed at how useful it is as when i first bought it
these devices are not toys
they will help you organize you life in a way you would never had thought possible and i am still thinking of new ways to use all the time
i just noticed something interesing about my palm and thought id mention it here
a minute ago i put my palm in its cradle to do a hot sync
i pushed the button but nothing happened
i tried it again but again nothingthen i noticed there was a reminder notice on the screen
i cleared it by tapping the quotokayquot button and after that i was able to hot syncapparently the palm os considers a reminder notice to be at a lower interrupt level than a hot sync which if you think about it is probably true since you wouldnt want to miss a reminder notice because it got blown away by the hot sync screenjust one more thing that shows how wellmade and thought out these little gadgets areone other thing
i also have a compaq ipaq which i also have become very attached to in addition to my palm
although the ipaq hot sync process is a little easier than the palm you just put it in the cradle and the unit is automatically detected you dont have to hit a button as with the palm the palm does have one advantage here
i can hot sync when im dialed in and online with the modem in use
the ipaq uses a usb port which looks for a free com port to work with and this conflicts with the modem
when i try to hot sync while using the modem i get a message that there is a conflict and it wont hot sync
this is despite the fact that my system has two com ports and the microsoft windows diagnostics shows the second com port as free and not in usehowever one interesting thing the ipaq does is you can work with it while it is hot synching
you still cant do that for the palmsthe time arrived for me to upgrade from my trusty old palm v i was running short on memory so that left the palm iiic vx and jornada  for considerationi tried the iiic for a month
found the color screen a  pleasure to work with
there are not that many rd party apps in color yet  but that appears to be changing fast
i liked the tinysheet excel  compatible spreadsheet in color
the black on white screen is very readable  for ebooks
battery life was acceptable
on a  week business trip i had  to recharge it only once
the downside for me is size the comfort factor
you can not comfortably carry a palm in a shirt pocket
i carry it in my  pants pocket with the v i would forget i had it until i needed it
the  iiic it was just always there
the only other gripe i have is that its  almost impossible to read the screen outside
something i took for granted  on the monochrome v bright daylight however fully washes out color  screens
i really like the small updates to the new palmos
eg
the  little shortcut bar that appears at the bottom of the screen for menu  shortcuts is an excellent innovation
it makes cutting and pasting as fast  as with the pc using the keyboardi used the jornada for  weeks before  i returned it
as my expectations werent that high from my previous  exposure to the platform i cant say that i was dissappointed
however i  still dont think ms is up to par
on the balance still more clicks are  needed than on a palm
i couldnt find those easy to use rd party freeware  apps such as the ny crossstreet finder on pocketpc
on face value i liked  excel but i found its small differences with the pc version annoying
knowing one i made assumption about the other that didnt always pan out
the high resolution of the screen is nice
for ebooks the jornada would be  good if not for the poor passive matrix screen
for example on the plane  i could put the iiic on the tray in front of me and read at an angle
this  is impossible with the jornada screen
for basic pda functions it is  adequate
i feel the apps still are a bit sluggish
playing mps is fun  but with  songs at cd quality memory is depleted which makes it  impracticle for multimedia unless you spend more to expand memory
forget  playing mps in the background while doing other work the device slows  down to a crawl
size wise the jornada is a bit bigger and heavier than  the iiic which to me is a problem as i already explained
battery life  seemed shorter than the iiic though it may be subjective because it was on  a lot while learning the pocketpc platformthe palm vx is basically a  faster palm v with more memory
just got it yesterday and i already love  it
this is the one im keeping
i suppose that after getting used to the  size and weight of the palm v there is no going back
however im glad  that i went through the hassles of trying out the other  models
i learned  a few things size matters until technology for multimedia  matures color screens do not add significant value to justify their impact  on size and battery life pocketpc looked good on face value but  didnt go the distance however i do believe that as technology advances  multimedia such as mp playback will be great to have
i hope that by that  time palm will have the capability rd party apps add tremendous  value
something i forgot until i couldnt find my favourite little addons  that make life easy such as accountmanager cross street finder etcall  in all the best favor you can do yourself is getting one
got my parents a  palm v  months ago now i have to get them another one so they stop  fighting over itwhen my palm v was stolen last may i went right out and bought a palm vx to replace it
upfront i should address the comment of the reviewer below who complained of losing his data when the device crashed
the palm vx comes with software that allows you to create a copy of all your palm data on your computer
if you lose the palm data for some reason or the computer data you can restore the lost data with a couple of mouse clicks
the palm comes with a quotcradlequot that is used for recharging and for linking to the computer
when my palm was stolen i easily restored my information into my new palm vx
the process of storing data takes about  seconds and literally just takes a button push after you have put your palm in the cradle
i should mention that in  months of extensive use ive never quotlostquot my data due to software failure
i did lose it when my palm was stolen of course but was  easily able to replace it
i find two main uses for my palmas a scheduler i can enter something i want to be reminded of at a future date and have the palm alert me at a specified time typically five minutes before the meeting starts for meetings at my work
you can easily view all the items in place for each day and there is also a weekly view
this can be done years in advance and doesnt have to be for work stuffi have a gasket in an underwater camera which needs to be replaced in may  and i have entered a reminder to alert me at that time
the other thing i use it for is as a way to find quotforgottenquot information
i make and store memos of important conversation or important information
also i make notes in the quotaddress bookquot of key information about peoplethings ive discussed with them or areas of expertise they have
i can use the quotfindquot feature on my palm to locate a term
so if i want to know what conversations ive had about widgets or who i have talked to that knows about widgets i can enter quotwidgetquot in the find feature and i will be shown a list of all my memos that mention widgets in the text and anyone in my address book who i listed as being widgetrelated
incidentally ill also get a list of any appointments in my calendar that mention widgets
if you are a busy person and not just a business type students or homemakers may benefit as well i believe you will be able to make good use of a palm vx
you may be equally satisfied with a handspring or with other makes of palm though
the two great advantages i see with the palm vx or palm v if you can still find one are that the profile of the device is very slenderit fits in my front slacks pocket without leaving a substantial bulge
second advantage is that the internal battery provides power for a week to two weeks of use and can be recharged by resting in the cradle
no need to buy replacement batteries or juggle them around replacing themafter using a handspring but going through batteries too quickly i decided to upgrade to this timeless pda
i have no complaints with it other than the serial sync is a lot slower than the usb sync
i love the builtin battery metal case and slim size
i fit this in my pocket and it is a lot lighter than my wallet  now that the m discounts have hit the vx is coming down to very attractive pricesas an owner of jornada  and jornada  pocket pcs and a handspring visor prism ive had ample time to consider which of them is my favorite  and the palm vx winswhat i like  the small size simplicity razor sharp screen and ample memoryspecifics  this is the smallest of the pdas i own and its easy to slip into a shirt pocket
however the feature i most like is the standard palm applications which do a few tasks well and the wealth of thirdparty applications that can be easily downloaded
compared to the pocket pcs i own this and the size combine to make the vx my favorite
although this is the only pda i own that has a monochrome screen the vx is easier to read in all light conditionswhy choose a vx
by any standard this model is obsolete but is probably the best designed pda on the market  especially if you want a palmpowered pda instead of the more complicated pocket pc devices  because used ones are attractively priced and it makes an ideal entrylevel pda
it also may be the only pda for many people because it is rich with functionality appointments calendar phone list etc
 and remains compatible with tens of thousands of readily available programsso here is my little tale
i began my whole palm expedition several years ago with a palm professional yes back in the day
that worked out just fine for the time but being a gadget junkie i had to get the palm v when it came out
and can i say how much better it was
not only did you not have to deal with batteries but you didnt have the bulk that the palm pro had
a few other cool things  the cradle that has a place for your stylus
this may not seem like a big thing until you leave you stylus on your desk and go home and realize that you need it
and i never had any problems with the software
so as it was i was completely happy with my little stylish palm vthen handspring came out
and i had to have that  for the mp player
so i got rid of the palm and got on the waiting list for a little imac colored handspring
i was super excited  more memory and the cool springboard feature seemed like it would be nice
what a disappointment i was in for after having owned the palm v  first of all my stupid handspring crashed all the time
second it ate batteries like a hog  where the palm v didnt need batteries because it has the recharable lithium ion battery
third it is the same bulkiness as the palm pro
fourth there was no place for the stylus
and last but definetely not least the springboard modules turned out to be a joke  the release dates on them kept slipping
i guess part of my problem is being an early adopter  but i sure did miss my palmso i gave in and did what any gadget junkie would do
i sold the handspring and upgraded to a palm vx
and happy happy happy am ii am a busy doctor a macintosh user and an avid palm enthusiast
here is my bottom line if you dont have a palm vx you have to get one right  nowthe address book alone is worth the price of admission keeping  hundreds of names phone numbers addresses and email addresses instantly  accessible and categorizable and keyword searchable
the date book  instantly makes obsolete all those little paperbased pocket organizers
and the note pad and todo list are just the thing for jotting this or  that
synchronization with a usb mac is seamless and the mac software  based on claris organizer is quite good
be sure and buy the com palm  usb kit other rd party usbtoserial adapters i tried didnt work
but  where the palm really shines is in the rd party software much of which is  free that is available over the web
epocrates for doctors a hypertext  drug guide a la the famous pocket pharmacopoeia will become your portable  brain for drug selection and dosing
and avantgo a service that allows  daily downloading of nearly any textbased web site into your palm is  highly useful i use it for news general and medical sports scores  current movie showtimes in my area day weather forecasts and a daily  joke
it eases the pain of spending  hours straight in the hospital
vindigo a free city guide to restaurants and nightlife is great but takes  too long to sync every day adds about  minutes to a normally  minute  sync so i took it offthere are also freeware amusements mulg  dopewars and ca
explorer are currently installed on mine and electronic  books victor adams and roppers pocket neurology text for instance  that may be of use to you
 mb is plenty for all of the above  i have   mb to sparethe batteries recharge overnight in the cradle and last a  long long time
i would offer  caveats   mac outlook express wont  interface with the nice email app eudora does though if you want to  switch
  you cant just carry the palm around in your pocket
itll  fall out onto the floor and the screen will crack
get either the deluxe  carrying case or the leather belt case
i have one of each and prefer the  belt case for practicality and fallproofing if i was worried about  looking professional i might use the deluxe case in my white coat top  pocket insteadim not a pda junky but i sure stay very busy and thisdevice is the best christmas gift ive ever hadpalm vx has plenty of muscle to cover my everyday needsand keeps me focused in my daily reports plus my own personalagendatheres the m now with mb but will you ever use themi doubt itif youve been doing youre homework on all of the pdas out there now then you probably have heard all about those quotpalmquottop computer systems
what ive found that is most disturbing about those palmtops is  that they have so much more than you need are larger have reduced battery  lifes and are about twice as expensive as the wonderous piece of equipment  i am reviewing nowthe palm vx is the latest and in my opinion the  greatest palm of all the ones that com have produced
using the latest  version of the palm os this device comes loaded with  megs of ram a  battery that will last up to a month on one charge enough programs to  organize your entire life and an easy to learn writing technique called  graffiti
and although it may not be quite as accurate as on the more  expensive pdas it does the job and there is also a built in keypad that  can be used to input informationsyncronization with your computer or  laptop is simple too
just place the palm in its handydandy charging  station which is included and hit the hotsync button
all of your days  notes scheduals information and whatever is easily backed up to your  hard drive
and anything that you add to the computer transfer program  will be uploaded to the palm vx
in short the setup is easy the programs  are user friendly and did i mention it only weighs  oz
also unlike  its palm bretheren mainly the palm iiis which have a hokey plastic  casing this palm has a very sleak magnesium casing that is both stylish  and that just feels damn good in your handhowever it does have its  downsides
for starters the built in ir infrared port is almost useless  beyond  inches away which means that the transfer function between two  palms although nice isnt very useful in most real world situations
hell you cant even beam a signal across and empty room
second unlike  its cousin the visor which was produced by the company who had the  original idea for the palm it has no extra memory slot and therefore  cannot have extra memory added to it
however since there is not much  that would use all  megs on the palm vx you wouldnt need to expand your  memory anyway
and thirdly expect to buy a real case for the palm  immediatly after your initial purchase since all the palm comes with is a  cardboard cover in leather that is attached to a stylus pen and that fits  in one of the two pen slots on the palmin general i find that the  palm vx surpasses its more expensive competitors in every way from price  to simplicity from form to function
and if you need to get your life in  order without dropping a boatload of money on a color screen and useless  extras then this is your best bet
and to put it simply i wouldnt trade  my palm for any quotpalmquottop pda if you paid meif youre still  curious about the more complex pdas go check out my review for the  cassiopia e
enjoyrevuman  hey
can ya let me outta the screen  please
peacei have had my palm vx since late  i am still using it today february  i would love to now upgrade to a color palm
however i am very fearful that i will not find another pda which offers the durability and longevity ive received from my current palm
i will continue to use my palm vx until it dies  permanently
there were times when i thought it had died but discovered there was a button that was depressed and i didnt know it
that caused the battery to die and be unchargeable
once i figured out the problem i depressed the button recharged the unit and went back to business as usual
i love my palm vx
is there anything comparable
if so please email me at deleciacoxnetthe nino with case mb cf card and battery weighed oz
the palm vx was  only oz with battery and slim palm case
the palm was also about half as  thick and an inch shorter with the same screen size although an inch in  taken up with the writing area
i first bought the nino because as a  longtime pc user i thought that wince would be more versatile
i thought  microsoft would win the battle of the platform thoughts of apple thorough  my mind
i didnt want to find that i ran out of memory before it could do  everything that i needed it to do
i found the nino a palmtop computer  trying to be an organizer and the palm an organizer trying to be a palmtop  computer
the nino could do everything and was very expandable
it is a  handheld computer but it was just too darn big to carry around in my  pocket
i dont carry a briefcase or travel for business
i wanted an  everyday organizer to hold contacts itineraries notes lists  appointments financial information simple maps and do some calculations
the palm vx does all this in such a small size
if i needed to use a  computer on the road id buy a laptop
i dont need to edit word  documents do any database work access the internet use multimedia or  color read books or play elaborate games on it
i just wanted something to  hold basic information and do relatively simple calculations till i could  transfer it back to my computer
so far it does everything that my nino  did but with less memory
i still have  memory left
about  mb out  of  for the palm vs  mb out of  for the nino with cf card the  programs use less memory
it my case size mattered
i found i was never  carrying the nino when i needed it
id leave it in my car
overall the  palm does everything i need and want it to do
i do worry about  expandability but so far it hasnt been an issue
if i had gone with the  palm v id be in trouble
if you want something that could do those other  things id just spend the money for a laptop
the nino could do those  other things but not very well compared to a laptop
if they could cut  back on the size of wince or pocketpc devices i think id consider them
till then im sticking with palmdue to bumbling on the part of palm the palm vx is still the standard in small easy to use fullfunctioning pdas
sporting a fullsize screen compared to the puny screens on the m m and m and a lithium rechargeable battery the palm vx remains the sleekest lightest pda on the market
it fits easily into your hand or your shirt pocket
now that its price appears to be coming down it is a great buy especially compared to the overpriced mpalms newest highend models the m and m are a bit better than the vx mainly because of a new card slot and a slightly more tactile feel
the m also offers some rather anemic color
but palms software hasnt really improved much since the palm vx came out imho and the expansion slot is not so compelling to me that it would be worth paying the additional doughalso as an aside make sure that you download three free addons for palm os avantgo a service that downloads articles from the new york times sports illustrated cnn and others every time you sync your palm vindigo a city guide with restaurant and movie reviews and mapopolis which has street maps that are keyword searchableenjoyintroyou can read all the reviews there are a lot to help in making up your mind on the palm vx
for this short review im going to just focus the pros and conspros very slim normal wallet size so you dont need a pda case very long battery life  week mature product platform reliable cheap apps etc clear monochromatic display in most daylight conditions tons of applications mb is plenty of memory for calendar notes todo documents to go word excel and a couple of subscriptions from avantgo easy to find replacement parts inexpensive to buy and maintain tons of accessories bulletproof metal casingcons noncolor screen only mb of memory not expandable new applications have longer load time serial connection usb adapters are available external adapters required for bluetooth and wireless connectivityconclusionthats my  cents
i just purchased another one for  after abusing the heck out of my ibm c its the same unit as the vx for  years
i could have bargained him down but mint for  is worth every penny
for those interested i think i paid  for the c back in  yes this model is obsolete but ill keep it until there is an inexpensive small wallet sized pda with wireless and a comparable battery lifei hope you found this helpfuli have been a dayrunner junkie for years
the problem is i stopped carrying it everywhere especially afterhours because it just got so big
i got the palm vx a few months ago and it has completely replaced my  dayrunner
it totally syncs with my outlook so i have the one schedule at  the office and on the palm
i have more than  contacts with phone  email addresses and notes
i have the last  days worth of email  messages
i have the latest fodors guide for my home city and the ability  to download any city i am visiting
i have the a daily listing of the  current movies which theaters are showing and the times
i have hearts  a favorite card game  with jack of diamonds is worth 
i can take  short notes and make reminders
it beeps to let me know when the next  appointment is going to happen lets see a dayrunner do that
and i  have barely scratched the surface of what this thing can do
if you are  considering getting a pda  i cannot recommend this device enough
oh  and it is so small that i take it everywhereyou can read all you want about the specs on this thing
instead im going to go at this review by giving you a flavor for how i use mine
ive had my vx for about a year and a half now
im very computer literate with a professional job in which i travel often have numerous appointments and am on the phone regularly
but until last year i was married to my appointment book and rolodex
in fact i carried my rolodex yes the entire thing with me on trips
i finally gave up that circus act and bought a pda
all i can say is that i feel empowered now
i have all my key information at my fingertips and the ability to add and delete on a moments notice information like a new phone number or a change in the time of an appointmenti went with the vx because of its sleek design
it slips easily in and out of my pants pocket or suit jacket inner pocket
the stylus is a bit dainty but you have to deal with it to get the benefit of a thin device
graffiti is easy and fast enough once you practice a little  the menus are easily accessible if you need help figuring out how to make a particular punctuation mark or some symbol
i find the hardcover is enough protection for the screen  no need to protect the entire device in another case
the screen is defintely vulnerable to scratches so be careful to only use the stylus when writing or buy some of those disposable plastic sheets that overlay on the screen
it syncs very easily onetouch in the cradle and the battery will last for a couple weeks probably  hours of usage if you dont recharge it at all
id recommend synching at least every week so that your information is safely stored on your pc in case you lose the palm a nice benefit of pdas that obviously didnt come with my appointment bookrolodex setup  
note that youll have to buy a cradle with a serial port included with purchase  i couldnt find one with a usb  so make sure you have a serial port on your laptop if thats what youll be synching to or youll have to buy an adapter that would sit between the vx and your laptopwhat do i do with this thing
just to give you a flavor here are some things i can do now that make my life a lot easier
since the palm allows you to schedule a certain event on a recurring basis i put an entry on my calendar for  pm on the rd of every month to change my furnace filters
and i set the alarm on the palm just as a reminder
i also keep numerous memos including one to write down any movies id like to rent when someone mentions a good one and another with christmas ideas for my wife
finally i record business expenses in it during trips which makes filling out the reimbursement forms easierfinally make sure you enhance your palm experience by checking out three sites  avantgocom vindigo and various shareware sites
avantgo offers information downloads from hundreds of sites covering general business technology entertainment news as well as recipes jokes airline schedules etc
i download main stories from cnn reuters cnets technology and ncaa college basketball via the sporting news
vindigo offers geographically based information  a way to locate restaurants movie theaters etc
just by telling your palm where you are
much of the shareware out there is of marginal value but i did download a neat little program that turns my palm into a mirror by blacking out the entire screenin sum i think the vx is a great entry level device especially at current prices
in the long run i worry about microsofts pocketpc operating system becoming more versatile it probably already is
but for someone moving from paper to digital the palm vx is a lowrisk proven successvery reasonable  reliable product
does what it claims to do
easy to use switches very easily
note that it converts composite video to svideo  vice versa
so you only need to make one video input connectionsvideo or composite video
highly recommend to anyone looking for simple manual audiovideo switchi bought the recoton svs after getting a second vcr and a dvd player for my tv
this despite the fact that my tv had three video inputs to begin with
these days a couple of inputs isnt enough
especially when you count video game systems and camcorders
getting this saved me from having to swap cables all the time which is what i was duing until i got it
its simple to use just plug and click
its a great time saverim sure this is a great device but i couldnt use it on my tv
i have an older tv with only one hookup on the back
this device requires two hookups on the back of your tvso i had to return it
however i did purchase another device from this same seller
i called their tech number and they told me exactly what i needed gave me the item number to enter online and the cables i would need and the item numbers for them
they have a great tech team there and they were very helpful
i returned this item but ordered another one from them that does work
great site to work with
i will purchase from them again when i need any electronic device
thanks tech support from parts express for helping me with my problemyoure the greatestmost modern television sets come with only two audiovideo  front and back and one svideo connectors
so what do you do when your dvd player satellite receiver playstation tivo etc want those for themselvesyou can either move your television and plugunplug whatever youre going to use at the time which can drive you nuts not to mention wear out your connectors or just invest in one of these little thingsi love how simple the recoton is
you just plug your stuff into the back of it up to  different devices then run another set of cables from the quotoutquot jacks to the back of your tv
thats it
ive seen other little boxes that do the same thing for hundreds of dollars and need electricity to work
a total waste of money in my opinion
i keep my recoton on top of my television set and switch between each device with a push of a button now
no more having to deal with wires everywhere or moving the tvthe recoton doesnt come with extra cables to run from the back of it to your tv set so if you dont have some spare av and svideo cables around be sure to get a set
i personally use the brand from monster cable which has wonderful picture qualityi was getting frustrated because my quotoldquot receiveramp ran out of places to plug things in  i was having to choose which items to leave out and it was frustrating me that i couldnt enjoy my hifi system w all  my devices
for just  this little device came to my rescuetheres  a much more expensive version in the crutchfield catalog like 
sure  that one has a few extra bells and whistles but i dont think it justifies  teh  extra like a remote that only has  buttons
this sucker  is all you need if you own a dvd vcr game station etcof course it doesnt create svideo out of composite stupidim amazed at people who dont get it sometimes
this device is areal dandy for hooking things up to your home entertainment systemand for connecting things to the computer it cant be beat
i have atuner to play my mps through with bookshelf speakers analogcamcorder vcr remote feed cameras from a company called x allsorts of stuff
svideo is only used for other svideo connectionsyou can buy a gizmo which will convert av into svideo right here atamazon but it costs about a hundred bucks and isnt worth it becausethe quality doesnt improve
it just eliminates a connector on onepart of the system
instead of plugging and unplugging things fromthe back of my computer i just have this one switchbox and reach upand punch a button down
i have one on my computer and one on my homeentertainment system and it works on either system quite well
whatis cool about reaching around into the back of your system wheneveryou want to change something because of a lack of connections
forthe computer sound system it gives you the flexibility of inputting tothe linein and if you have an allinwonder video card or two likei do you can hook up arrangements for sound video input as well ashaving a firewire
for the money this thing is a great piece ofequipment and if i didnt think so i wouldnt have twocountem twoof them in my house alreadyi use it for my tivo dvd player and playstation and it works great
if you dont mind pushing a button then it is much easier on the wallet then the  automatic models available
the only thing to be aware of is that  it does not come with an extra svideorca cable to go from the box to the  tv so if you dont have one be sure to pick one up at the same timewhat can you really say about a cd case
well for one thing the price for these things have really come down over the years
i remember when a large capacity case such as this one used to cost up to  bucks
 which in my opinion was way overpriced
im glad to see that the price has dropped to a reasonable level
i like this case
its easy to retrieve and insert cds from and back into the pages
the outside material feels better than the old school faux leather
so if youre in the market for a case to store all your freshly ripped music and flicks this is a good choice for the frugal shoppersi reading the reviews on here i was skeptic at best about buying one of these cd cases
but being that i have well over  cds approaching  i need something big for storage so decided this was the best bang for the buck
this case is well constructed and doesnt tear although some reviewers would have you think it tears just by looking at it
if you feel the need to carry over  cds with you wherever youre going youre an idiot in the first place this case is perfectly suited for what i need storage
these cases have a cleaning wipe in the front that is attached to the case which is something you wont find in a case logic case that people seem so orgasmic about which by the way i have two of and they arent as good as this
anyway i bought  of these now and when i fill the last one up i will buy another and another these are the best value you will find anywhereas a victim of shoddy cd wallets for years  rings that become warped seemingly on their own plastic tabs that scratch the backs of cds etc
 the fellowes case is a welcome respite from the  lower quality units from cdprojects
fellowes construction is tighter cd pages better designed zipper a lot more sturdy
the builtin polish cloth is likewise clever albeit somewhat useless being physically attached to the caseperhaps i stand alone but in my humble opinion ringed enclosures are a nuisance in larger capacity cd wallets
simply put these wallets cant handle the bulk weight of the cds not to mention the girth of the pages squashed into them
this fellowes case plus a similar caselogic offering i purchased last year can handle what its designed toand wellin sum this case is a steal at this price
supersaver shipping makes you feel almost as if amazon is paying you for itthis is a nice case for the money with loads of capacityi bought this in  when i decided to get rid of my cd jewel cases and move them all into something that takes up less room
 years later and it still works
i keep a cd on one side of the page and the liner notescoveretc on the other
holds up perfectly for those looking for longterm cd storagei use this to store cds and dvds at my office and it has worked fine for me with no complaints for over  years now
does what it is supposed to dothe case logic wallet holds only  cds compared with  but that is a lot of cds
the looseleaf design stronger constructionthe handle especially and greater ease of access make it the first choice
i cut down the bookletsetc and was able to fit the the full  with all the extras still with good access
to have all of my boxes metamorphized into one sleek package not much larger that my fullsize binoculars case makes me happy every time i look over at itthis is obviously not for anyone quoton the goquot
i dont go anywhere i need over  disks
ive purchase several of these to catalog and store my collection of music cds
ive also needed space for the new cds im downloading and burning
this is a great deal on a huge storage solutioni am very happy with it
all my cddvd fit nicely in the sleeves with the paper of the songs
i bought  more
doesnt scratch cddvdsok so this camera will not be able to take photos that can be blown up to a poster size
however i bought this camera fairly cheap just under twohundred dollahs earlier this year and it is fantastic
its sturdy the glass is sharp and the photos look amazing
the color the white balance and the contrast are just spot on
just look at photos taken by this camera by this camera on flickr and youll see this thing takes some beautiful photos
its quick to focus its got great battery life and snaps photos really quick
you wont regret buying this camerai got this from amazoncom  days ago and is still shooting away
sharp pictures excellent focusing amp light weighthere are some negative points if thats what you are looking for  it is a battery hogger
the  energizer alkaline battery pack that came with the camera lasted only for about  pictures
you need rechargeable nimh battery
 andthe charger is even more money
you dont really need the optional ac adapter
it is just another thing to load the electrical outlet near the pc
the mb compactflash card is just not enough if you want to stick to the x resolution which is the default
at normal compression you can have only  pictures
i feel that x resolution should have been the default
x is only available in advanced options
at x the mb card can hold  pictures at normal compression which is good enough for me
but if you want to stick to x you may be better off considering a card with more capacityi decided not to reduce the number of stars because of these negative points because the quality easily makes up for them and these negative points may be unavoidable as in the case of battery usage or not applicable to all as in the case of resolution amp storage sizei had been using nikon n nondigital for years and had fallen love with that camera
i guess the n will have to excuse me now i must admit that i like having new electronic toys when they come out
i purchased a digital camera in  and was not entirely impressed by what  got me then
however  years later i stumbled upon the nikon  coolpix  at a great price and took another shot at digital  imagingpictures the pictures it takes are fantastic
the x  resolution really makes a difference when making prints
they look like  they were taken with a mm
this is not even mentioning the backing of a  quality nikkor lens that picks up lots of detail other digicams of the same  resolution do not
another feature that impressed me was the fact i could  add additional lenses to it and nikon has  designed specifically for the  coolpix features it has a lot of features of its bigger  brother like an uncompressed tiff format ability to take bampw pictures  and adjustable metering
however for a nonprofessional photographer i  liked the fact the auto mode was easy to use and allowed me to take great  pictures right away
i now can switch to manual mode to take more control  of the picture but the camera is ready to take great pictures right out of  the box
unlike other reviewers mine came with a paper manual in addition  to a cdrom that explained many of the basic features and taught me about  some of the more exotic onesthis is a great camera for anyone wanting a  digital camera that takes great pictures but doesnt want to spend ton of  money on features that may not even be used
otherwise the cp and the  d are really nice cameras for those interested in more control
i do  recommend getting an extra flash card since  mb does run out fairly  quickly when taking pictures in fine or normal mode
getting a usb sandisk  compactflash reader was also a big help since the builtin connection is  serial and can take a long time to download pictures if you have a lot of  themthe kodak dc is exactly what a serious soho user or amateur photographer should be looking at as their bottomline diigital camera
i researched and waited for ages for the right combination of features and  price to come available
when i saw the dc for  compared to the  near it was a few months ago i knew the time was right and pulled  the triggereverything i need in a personalprofessional camera is  basically here
the photo quality at top resolution is beyond anything  youd expect
when people see a photo from the dc printed on the hpc  they are taken aback at how good it really looks
one of the greatest  sources of differentiation in the quality of film camera output lies in the  quality of the paper that was used
i have hundreds of family photographs  from the s to  which vary widely in how clear they look
but no  matter how good the best studio photographers shot looks it cannot  surpass the clarity of the dcs best picturesthe dc is not a  perfect camera
there are saturation problems as well its greedy use of  batteries
the mb flashcard that comes included has to be one of the  reasons the camera is so inexpensive along with there not being any ac  adapter includedthe kodak software works perfectly in windows  but  is flakey in windows  se
however one hidden bonanza came to light when  i used thumbsplus  to acquire the images off the camera you can save  them as lossless tiff files instead of the default jpeg files that the  camera usesthis camera will help my business and will help me be as  creative as i want to be
it was worth every penny i spent
you should give  it a try as welli am a photographic and computer enthusiast and having these two elements come together is a delight for me
so i have all the very expensive stuff including kodaks m commercial digital cameras
so i know what quality  is and how much it costs
bottomline as starters the dc makes great  color shots with very suprising hidetail
the advertisments say  quotgoodquot for x photos however as a very picky guy when you  get past x print sizes the pictures start to turn fuzzy
but the x  prints are shockingly clear with brilliant colors
but so what how many  prints does one make larger than x anyway
this camera is easy to use  amp small and i carry it on vacation locations when i dont want to  carry my larger and heavier commercial camera
i was truly shocked at the  excellent picture quality of the  also kodak includes great software  so after a picture taking daynite one can easily connect to the yellow  video plug on your tv or hotel tv for a slide show of the days  activities
i would recommend purchasing a mb memory card with the camera  purchase so youll get plenty of picture opportunities  shots without  having to worry about using up memory
in other words since you can erase  shots you dont like take many many shots and pick the best ones you like  for printing or emailing
i bring my laptop with me on trips so in the  evening i can copy the photofiles to the hard disk and erase the camera  memory card in preparation for the next days photo activities
kodak  provides serial usb cables and software to accomplish this simply
definitely do not buy a digital camera with less than  pixels
the older models presently having good sale prices are technology of   years ago and youll wish you spent the extra money for this camera
since kodak has been the color business for  years wellyears  its no surprise that they have created an electronic imager the ccd chip  with the best color quality and detail
this is a must have youll not be  dissappointed
if you have another few hundred dollars check out the sony  or olympus dyesublimation printers which produce actual photo quality  continuous tone prints up to x sizes these printers are not dotmatrixs  with all the little dots
the camera and the printer makes for a great  combo family gift for under m that anyone in the family can use without  having to even turn on a computer as the printer prints directly off the  camera memory card
so that you dont make yourself craze and since its  slightly different than a typical film point and shoot camera be sure to  read the instruciton booklet before pushing all the buttons
the  documentation kodak gives you is very easy to understand so take it slow  when you open the box for the first time
its so intuitive to use after  the first  outings you not need to keep going back to the booklets
jlwi am a beginner to digital photography and this camera has me hooked
it is easy to learn easy to use and produces beautiful pictures
congrats to kodak for including the charger with batteries and the regular batteries  so i was able to take pictures as soon as the camera arrived
congrats also  to amazon for having the best price i could find on the web
the software  works well but i wish kodak had included the home version of adobe instead  of the business version
this camera is a definite winner and i highly  recommend it to both the beginner and experienced photographerresolution quality is fantastic for the amazoncom price
it comes with  battery charger which is a must
i print great x pictures
if you want  to take many high resolution picture order an extra memory cardprice getting better  i paid close to  oct quality great
the pictures are unbelievable and i mean that
if i print a x on my hp c it is hard to tell the difference from a mm camerafunction the  camera could use a better design but it is still much better than some  other ones i have tried
the review screen is perfectly placed where your  nose hits it when you are taking a picture so i am constantly cleaning it  offin high quality mode mine holds about  pictures meg card
this is plenty for most eventsphoto ops
after i take  pictures i go  back and review them and delete the ones that i dont like
this way when  you have  pictures in your card they are  pictures that you like
much  better that taking a whole roll of mm pictures and only liking  of them  once they are developedoverall i love the camera and so do all my  friends that try itas this camera has been replaced by the  it has fallen in price but not in performance
in fact it performs as well as its replacement and costs a good bit less
for a  meg camera it offers a great deal
it is well built has great optics a x true zoom decent battery use usb support and enough user controls to make it an acceptable camera for a semiserious photographer
the resolution is more than adequate for internet apps and good enough for printing clear  x s
it is also very sturdy
i think that while supplies last it is the best  meg around and would be an awesome christmas present for almost anyonethis is a very solid camera that takes good pictures indoor or outdoors
it is very user friendly and consistently takes good pictures no matter who is taking them unlike several sonys i tried before settling on this onetheir are several features on this camera that make it particularly appealing to me
 accepts any type of aa battery and comes with rechargeable ones transfers pictures through usb can also get a compact flash card reader i highly reccommend
 has a video patch cord that allows you to preview pictures on any tv or vcr with an rca input
 accepts flash memory of any brand up of  mb alot of pictures
 border software allows you to import different borders for your shots such as birthdays and weddingsalthough the camera is only a  megapixel ive learned megapixels dont tell the whole story for the quality of a picture
they only become important if you want to consistently produce picture sizes above x x takes a dip in qualityoverall a very good camera for an enry level to average userif you are a more advanced user with higher resolution needs you might checkout the nikon coolpix  series a very good camera though it is twice the price of the kodak  zoomusing the rechargable battery that came with the camara i took more than  pictures maybe  of them used flash
the battery still not dried up before i quiti own this baby for more than  month
yesterday i bought a  mb compactflash memory from amazon
now i realize it is too much for this camara
it can store  pictures with  x  resolution
boythe only drawback of this camara is the delay between shots
first  only delay  seconds but after that needs about  seconds to processother than that it is perfectsince there are still a number of these available used through amazon markeplace i thought id add a quick review myselfmy parents bought one in about  and apparently used it very little
i inherited it in like new condition
im a moderateadvanced amateur photographer own several cameras including a sonyminolta dslr
this camera as others have noted takes very good pictures and is well made and easy to operate
many times higher resolution just isnt needed especially if you do a lot of web photography like i do
put an upgraded cf card in it a cf slot instead of sdxdwhatever are another sign of quality and youre good for hundreds or even thousands of shotsthe only down side is that it is slow by todays standards
its highest iso is only  if i remember correctly maybe not even that high and cf write times are a bit on the long side
the proprietary usbserial connector is annoying in  the original cable for mine is long gone and you cant use a standard usb cable  which isnt a real big problem since i generally use a card reader anywayid say this camera is much better built and takes better pictures than most of the sub  blister pack cameras out there  as long as mp is enough resolutionwe use this camera at a manufacturing facility for all our documentation
a picture is worth a thousand words and this camera is worth the price
it  is easy to use comfortable and easy to download to a pc
it is also very  durable
many people use this camera and it has gone through some abuse in  an industrial environment
the pictures have real nice color details and  sharpnessthe software that comes with it isnt the greatest
i  recommend photosuite iii or ms home publishing to get the most out of your  digital picturesextra memory is also a must have
invest in a  or   mb memory card and you can take pictures all daythis camera replaces my sony mvcfd digital camera
there is no comparison
the dc takes true photographic qualitiy pictures
i tried the camera in a variety of difficult lighting situations
it took perfect pictures every time
the software interface is great
it makes the camera  look like another drive letter in your computer
when the camera is plugged  into the computer usb port the drive letter appears in windows explorer
you can then simply navigate and use the standard cut and paste tools to  move the files
i am extremely impressed with the qualitiy of the pictures  ease of use and clear instruction manuals
the camera does eat the  batteries
it comes with a set of disposable so you can use the new camera  while the others are charging and rechargeable with charger
i purchased a  second set of rechargeable batteries
i simply charge one set while the  other is in useim just an amateur photographer but in the past  years ive owned three mm slr cameras and two autoeverything mm cameras
the kodak dc is my first digital and it operates about the same as the autoeverything  cameras
it cant do everything that an slr and a gadget bag full of  accessories can do and it doesnt have the quotfeelquot of an slr
but it does  of what i want and produces beautiful photos
ive had  mine for about four months and have taken almost  photos with it
last  week i went to the usaf museum and took over  photos about  of them  with it on a tripod using shutter speeds of  to  seconds
fantastic  quality
i bought an extra compact flash card m and two extra sets of  nimh batteries and took along my old notebook pc
when the picture cards  were full i transferred the photos to the notebook pc using a pcmcia  adapter then erased the card
that worked fine and i have not had any  problems transferring files to my home pc using the usb port eitherwhen  you consider that we were spending over  per year on film and  developing anyway going digital just made sense
i like the ergonomics of  the camera and the menus are easy to use  just spend a few minutes with  the manual
i was switching between a variety of modes at the museum to  get the best photos possible and it wasnt that difficult
i havent had  this much fun since i bought my first slr
coworkers were amazed by an  x portrait of my wife that i took with the dc and printed on photo  quality paper
kodak provides support through their web page including os  upgrades to the cameras softwarerecommendations  get a case and one  or two extra sets of nimh batteries
i havent bought the ac adapter for  it but i can see how it would be useful to some because it takes about   hours to recharge the batteries
the batteries will last longer if you use  the viewfinder instead of the lcd
the lcd is essential for close up shots  and the digital zoom only works with the lcd
a large compact flash card  is a good idea if you intend to use the best quality at high resolution  since the picture size in that format are usually around k
the  graphics software that comes with the camera is ok but better programs are  available for any serious photo editing you might want to doi bought these for my professional dj gig and the sound that comes out of these are really really clear
the thing that makes these cables great is the isolation from electrical interference power outlets any power cables etc and i personally use it from my idjpro to a pioneer djm nexus mixer
couldnt be happier with the build quality
one small small con for me personally is that the cables are not stuck together so i would suggest get a half dozen or dozen of velcro straps to keep things neatthese are great audio cables for the price
i highly recommend them
very nice build quality and appealing to the eyeso you know its always the best
its all i use on all my older audio equipment that still use line level audio output signalsthese are very good cables i use them for the big audio setup i have in my basement these sound absolutely amazing the highs are very well preserved the lows are very deep and the highs have very good detail the vocals of the midrange sound very good too i noticed that when i split open one of these to solder and shorten the cable that the internal conductors are not just stranded copper but they were a complicated frequency network wrapped in a way to take use of the skin effect which means higher frequencies sit more on outer conductors and bass is more in the middle the conductors inside the conductors are all individualy wrapped in their own insulation and are all pure copper the design inside is also the twisted pair in a way so it works simular to xlr or balanced cable it has silver solder contacts and the turbine connectorsplit tip make an extremely good almost direct connection to the audio equitment the rubberized jacket makes it very flexible and durable the cable is  shielded so no noise can be induced in the cableoverall this is one of the best cables i have bought and if you have a good sound system kick out the cheap cable and experience what a true audiophile wants in a great cable like this onethese are great cables there nice and heavy after make sure the tip is screwed on tight only one drawback the orings slip off or wear outill never forget the day i gave the order to throw away every single radio shack cable in the housethis company has been around a long time for a reason
good quality cables with no distortion or feedback with a great price
cables fit tightly and provided an excellent connection just exactly what i was looking for and the free shipping is always a bonusvery good quality cable
the fit is very tight so id recommend this for someone who has no plans of taking them out oftenfor many years and no other producer of cabeling has the high quality of monster for a very reasonable price
as one reviewer pointed out on resale venues like ebayamazonamazon is not responsible for ripoff items on their site but quickly makes restitution make sure you check to see that the connection grips are not plastic
there are a lot of those floating aroundive used monster for interconnects and speaker cables and have never had a problem
my equipment is pricey to say the leastmy system always sounded great and used to use radioshacks gold cables
i got these cause they were here on amazon where i bought my new dvd player
these cables are a lot more hefty than anything ive ever seen
i didnt compare quality to any other cables so i dont know about sound quality but it does sound good
if youre like me you probably want to spend more time infront of the tv than behind iti ordered several different brands of fiber optic cable to try so i have not opened the packaging for this item
however the packaging and product looks like a high quality product as can be expected from monster cablenothing wrong with this cable it is a brand name
the length is  meter or  feet  ideal for most component connections
it snaps in and out securely but not too easy to get disconnected ive read reviews of other cables with that problem thirteen bucks shippedi used to buy the cheapest available cables for stereo connections
i found out over the years that the sound quality was not real good using the cheaper cables
that being said my computer is on one side of the room and my tv on the other
i thought i was going to make the connection with several shorter cables
this particular cable is  ft long and very well made
it fit my needs perfectlythis cable performs well and is a bargain for the person who wants to sit back and connect his computer to his tv with hdmi
it couldnt have been easieri cant say whether they are worth the money becuase i havent tried similar products
however they do work well and they are built to survive a long time
they are incredibly thick for audio cables
if youre imagining something the thickness of the typical headphone or pcspeaker wire youre in the wrong ballpark  this is closer to the thickness of a powerstrip wire
its massive nay monstrous
the wire is still very supple and easy to manipulate
however if you plan to run it across your living room floor it will be extremely conspicuous
although you could certainly use it as a permanent connection its massive construction suggests that the intended use is probably in a setting where you will be frequently connecting and disconnecting packing and unpacking and generally giving the cord heavy use
it looks like it will take this kind of abuse fairly well
the endthis product is highly recommended  i have bought several for multiple appliancesi bought this to replace my cheap  strip and i feel better protected when using it with my  photo lighting systemim sure the  strip would function just the same but i used to sell monster cable back when the good guys was in business and this stuff always made a difference
it doesnt cost a little more just for the nameit costs more cause it performs and is worth itso i guess i have never really put this thing through the test but i do live in an area where there are power outages
no damage to any of my components sony  crt tv onkyo home theater in a box system sony dvd player comcast motorola cable box
not sure if it was the monster hat protected it or not but no problems
color code is convenient and plug is flat to hug the wall
good pricethis product works great for flat screen tvs with the tv on the wall it hangs perfectly and is ealy to manipulateworks just like it is supposed to no problems  it does exactly what i purchased it fora pimped out surge protector for the most expensive tech gear
sure it might be a bit overpriced but you get what you pay fori honestly have always trusted and loved monster cable
i have an  thousand dollar home entertainment center that is completely setup using nothing by monster cable wires
while i know that they are a little overpriced at times there is a lot to be said for peace of mind and also knowing that you systems are connected using the best wires and power sources money can buyi bought this as a bedroom outlet strip because i have a few things plugged in near my bed and also bought a bose sound dock and didnt want to plug it into a cheap power strip from the dollar store
i have been very happy with this and its worked perfectly for the first  months of owning it
additionally with the  or so monster cable items ive bought in the last  years not one of them have failed on me or delivered nothing but top notch performance
if you can about what you are plugging into it get a monster cable power sourceperforming as described and i like it so far but i guess the real test is when theres a power surge
i hopw that wont happen but it did then i will edit the review if necessaryits a powerstrip
and its easy to see the plugs
does what it should and feels well made
the endadded this to my  gallon aquarium setup liking it so far its tucked out the way now my aquarium equipment will be protectedi purchased a new tv for christmas with a blu ray player
i lose power a lot where i live when we get thunder storms
i got this to protect my electronicsthis surge protector comes with an unusually long cord making it easy to plug in multiple items with varying lengths of cord
the color coded outlets and coordinating enclosed labels help to maintain organization
great buythis is a simple easy power strip
i went to college so i know you dont have to plug the vcr in to the vcr color plug
it doesnt accommodate lots wall warts
also be careful of which way power converters are aligned
also nice long cordgood product very reliable
good signage to know what plugs are for what
packaging needs to be more eco friendlythis surge protector is great
i like the colors not because i actually plug anything in to certain pliugs but because it makes it easier to see when you are plugging in items while reaching behind cabinets and what notthe size of the strip seems to be slightly larger which makes for an easier fit with multiple items connectedi have also had some bad power surges in my house and this item has managed to handle them all very well
i even lost my microwave over one but my tv and game console were just fine after the surgemonster makes a superior productshort and sweet buy this to protect your stuffcant say a lot about a plug strip except that for about  bucks this is very hard to beat and from a major brand monster not really know for entry level pricing on their products
i like the color coding in addition to the pack of cable lables that let you mark what the plug is tofrom i usually make on with masking tape and a magic marker but this is a lot cleaner great product and at a very good priceit does the job and i have not had any problems with it so far
i would order more when neededfor the function at this price good
for the very good construction and thorough design to match the monster quality awesomebought a few of these to be surge supressors or power bars at various locations around the housethe price was right  could not complain as it does the jobi have had one of these for several years
recently i needed to get another surge protector
i went to target to buy one and all they had were only ft or  ft cords and were 
i looked this one up and was amazed that a monster product was only  bucks
what a deal
a name brand at a generic price
plus it has an  foot cord
the colors are cool if you frequently changed plugs but for me its just plug in and forgeti ordered this surge protector to protect a laptop and associated electronics at a builtin desk in my house
the slim design makes it take up less room behind the laptop
the right angle outlets allow two regular cords to be plugged in at the same time as two wallwarts so i can only use four of the six outletsdesigned for audiovisual equipment which have standard wall plugs all six outlets are available
the long power cord allows for convenient positioning even when not close to the wall outlet
i have since ordered more for other locations in the housethe colorcoded outlets are labeled for function but all appear to be identicalthe two big selling points of this product for me was
extra long cord length
excellent build qualitythe product came with outlets prelabeled and some sticker ribbons for the user to attach to the cords themselves
these are helpful except when you want to plug in something that is not audio  video related
not really that big of an issue thoughhahajust love the color code to know which plug to pull or to insert what where it belongsdont have any complaints about this unitits a great power strip
you can color code to which device goes to which plug
i just wish it had one more plug to completely meet my needs
the plugs are also spaced enough to allow just about any plug size without interfering with the next
a solid power stripmy nephew wanted this for christmas to plug in all his equipment
he loves it very much
im going to get one for myselfif yer color blind ya may not want this but for those of you that are like the rest of us this is a good power stripi now have this power strip in every room of my house
i plug all my vampire electronic products into it and turn off one switch to economize on the electricity drain of many electronics when they are not in use
this is a good looking power strip with a flat angled plug that sits close to the wall outlet
the cord is  longi purchased this as a lightning deal figuring that i needed another power strip
after i received it i was shocked and very pleased with the length of the cord for the power strip
i had planned on using it for something else but when i saw its monster capacity i changed out the power strip in my bedroom to plug my entertainment system into along with my computer
i am very pleased and cannot believe the steal i got on thisi really appreciate how each plug is colorcoded
i was able to sharpie the plug to match the color of the plug and it makes finding which cord goes to which device easy
love iti bought this as a gift for my husband and it works perfectly
we were looking for a power strip that faced to the side rather than to the skinny end hope that makes sense
this did exactly what we wanted even though we didnt use it for a tvgreat value for a monster branded product
so far so good
seems to hold up and love the color code on the bar vs having to put a tag on each pluggood surge protector for the price
outlets are not too close to each other
seams sturdy
the labels such as vcr or tvsat are completely unnecessary but they dont hurt anythingthe color coding is of only somewhat value
the important thing is that the plug to the wall is flat
the cord is also a decent lengthi dont know what some of you are talking about when you say that this is an inferior product
monster is a really good quality brand
the outlets are tight so you dont have to worry about your cords coming out and losing power
it might be a bit much but its not that hard to get in
someone said they had to put their full weight into it to get plugged in they must be a wimp since a small guy like me was able to easily push it in with a little force
it looks a bit fruity but it works really well
plus the long cable is nice to have since none of my outlets are near my computer deskwell im not going to test the thing for its endurance but it does supply power to my less expensive home theatre system i wish it has a higher rating for being a monster cable powersupply but it works just fineand works  i dont really make use of the colors but i find it attractive
i just put a plug in the holes and that is that
really this one is constantly in use and things go in and out and that is good for me
my phone charger hair dryer ipad charger etc
very convenient and attractivevery useful and simple surge protector find much use out of it when hooking up different components of my home theater system also it pre labeled as well as color coded which can be very useful when connecting various different itemsuh its a power strip so whats to say
it works
you plug things into it and they work
actually the best thing about this one is it comes with little stickers that you can attach to the end of plugs on your electrical devices so if you unplug something youll know what it is
though it should include blank ones so you can name things yourself such as ps or router things like that
anyhow this was a great price and this seller ships real quick so you cant losethis powerstrip keeps me from buying a new computerhave bought about  of these due to lightning strikes and they have saved my computer ever timewell what can you really say about a surge protector
it works as to shutting of the electrical equipment when you switch the button on or off
i dont know if it will shut down if damaging electrical spikes comes but i expect it does
the size of the product is slim and does not take up much room
the color coded receptacles are very nice and i am very happy i purchased it for the  low price amazon was selling it forcontrary to many negative reviews claiming this fails quickly i havent experienced that with either of my twothey are both still working correctlyone with my home theater and the other with a pci will update this review if i have any problemsthis is a great brand for the features and price
the main feature i needed was the flat profile wall plug
having a k plated connector color coded outlets and  ft cord were definite pluses
hard to find a better deal on a quality product like thisi like the color coding and labeling i just wish i could write in my own labels
good product would buy another onei like this a lot
it has a longer cord than most power strips
it is also a soft cable so it is easy to organize
for the discounted price this is a super deal on a great stripthis thing works well and the cable has a pretty decent length on it
the colors are nice to set things up and know what is what without having to label it yourself
ive had it for a few months and it is still going strongthis is a great power strip the warranty endorsed is great as well recommend to anyone specially at this pricei bought this power strip about  years ago
its still working well
i also like that the colorful design makes it look a little nicer than the ordinary power striplove the color coding
makes it easy to know which plug is which
i have no complaints and love the pricewhat can i say its a power strip with added colors to show you what goes where
thats pretty much it overall it works the wall plug is sturdy cable gauge is quite rugged and high qualitythe flat plug easily plugs in behind my dresser without bending the cord
the cord is  ft as described and long enough for my needs reach from plug behind dresser to window
im not crazy about the colors but it is a fine design
everything was as described and it works perfectlythis has been excellent for my computer and and other accessories i have been utilizing with my computer
since my purchase everything has been running very excellentlythe cord is long and thats why i like to use thisi have over recently however the price spiked and hope its only a temp supply issue its a good value and good build qual for the i was concerned because of the price i thought that this item could have a regular quality but its very good
i feel safe
monster is a great company with high quality standardsvery good power protector  for the price i liked its long thick cord thats why i brought  i brought it to replace my other brand defective power outletthese are my powerstrips of choice because of the super long cords and the angled plug that allows for tigh fits behind appliances desks dressers etconly bad part about these are  everytime i buy one i wish i would have purchased more at the time because it always seems as though i need another oneover the years ive purchase at least five of these monster power strips
i like that the cord is longer than most and the color coding system helps keep cords organizedyour standard power strip with surge protection
does the job outlets arent inaccessible and plugs go in just fine
colors are a bit obnoxious and the labels are completely unnecessary if you need this for other applications but it works just fine
and it comes with a rounded plug that stays out of the way and doesnt obscure more than one outleti ordered two of these in june  and have not had any problems with them whatsoever
great product and a great priceit works just fine and my wife is happy with it
it replaced a generic model which had three failed outlets
weve always had great experiences with our monster power strips and surge protectors so i expect this one will do just fineworks great
there is not much else to say
have an hdtv bluray player and satellite receiver hooked up
still workinga good deal for a quality product
monster has the best protection
amazon makes it affordable with their free shippingi recommend this power strip to all
the color coded graphic labels are great
light weight and durable construction is the bombjust what i needed for the problem i had
i would recommend it for those who have a need of a power stripdoes the job 
everything i buy on amazon i research it first  then i read the reviews before i buyi always get a decent productmonster mp av power protectorso much better than cheap units
our electric service is suspect no more holes blown from cheap units into the carpetingthis product is very useful and when i couldnt find anymore outlets this has helped me in a variety of ways and now i have  unlimited number of outletsin an area of the country where there are frequent electrical storms in the spring and summer months its important to have all your audiovideo computers and smart phones protected from static discharge
there are some cheaper strips out there but monster has been in the business for a long time and its worth a few extra dollars not to lose that  flat panel tv to a static dischargei got a good deal on this
i didnt buy it because it was monster brand
im not a monster fanboi or anything
i just saw it go on sale and got a good deal and i needed one
i like the layout of the plugs
it gives you a good variety of spaces for transformers etc
i have all my computer and stereo equipment plugged into it and it hasnt missed a beat
works for meive been literally moving my tv stand for years to unplugplug in equipment
well frankly my knees are getting too old for these floorlevel shenanigans and we have a lot of lightning in our area
i bought this item so that i could shut down equipment and plugunplug with ease
i particularly like the color coding for the different plugs because that tangled spaghetti behind my tv stand is pretty hard to decipherthe shipping was fast and packed well
i could not ask for morethis thing is huge it really is a monster
but it works great
i have every confidence that i am getting clean reliable power and surge protection
as well as great cable length
its easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device and offers superior cable management options
all around a great producti buy these for home and at work and they are great
one of the best power strips on the market that have good spacing so if you have larger power supplies it doesnt keep you from using the plug next to it
i have several of these and have never had one failit comes with a cable connector but ive never used it
i like that they also include some ties and the sticker labels for your equipment
for the money you cant beat itthis is so much more sturdy and safe than the typical power strips
the plug fits fairly flush to the wall socket and the sockets on it hold plugs securely without being too tight
i dont use the cable protectors so i cant speak to that
i highly recommend this to anyone needing a reliable safe power stripi bought two and all the pieces to a new desktop they have plenty of space and colored plug ins
it made everything very easy to set upmonster is one of my favorite brands 
this works great and i love the color coded labeling that lets me see at a glance what i am unplugging without having to trace it back to the particular unit
good job monsterthe rest of you buy thisit
