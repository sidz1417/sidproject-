al rebobinarlo se enredo y se dantildeo creo que la calidad es mala por que tengo otros y en ellos no sucedio lo mismoi just listened to frankenstein by edgar winter on this radio
it is stereo
maybe not the greatest stereo separation maybe its my brain but my belief that it is fm mono was incorrecti will add that i bought this for my wife to listen to when she is walking and she wont use it as she says the stations fade in and out
we are  miles from la so the reception is pretty goodoriginal reviewthe item description is incorrect
it says amfm stereo radio
when you look at the radio itself it says fmam
it only has fm mono and am
the description should be corrected
the sound is ok for mono but thats a lot different from stereo
i havent listened to the amive used this radio for a while now and ive concluded that its not very usable
the problem with it is the tuning dial
its tiny
everytime i want to tune in a station it takes ages to try to get it tuned properly
if your use is always to tune in one of the  or  most prominent stations on the dial then this will work fine
if not i strongly suggest getting something with a digital tuner
it isnt that much more expensive and will save you endless headachesthis radio probably worked well in some situation but performed lousy on mine
i listen to npr in my morning walks and need a good radio to listen to
so i bought this radio based on excellent reviews in amazon
i used it with my ipod headphones
and i got so much statics that i had to basically gave up on it
i tried it for a week and now know for sure
even my little sandisk sensa radios doing better than this big plastic thing
so i switched back to the sensait may do a better job with other stations with stronger signal but certainly not worth the  i spent
i didnt bother to send it back as it is cheap but right now it does nothing for meits small well built good sound quality easy to operate and light weight
my biggest serious problem with it is that it has a serious channel drift problem the program gets interrupted or weakened often when i walk or turn or move the radio from one pocket to another
this is a very serious problem for a portable radio
the other one is that the station dial is too imprecise
with the channel drift i have to fiddle with the dial all the time to get back to my station which is not easy to do with this particular dial i ended up throw mines away
my wife uses it in her work place which is located at a high ground and she said the reception is great
so guess the drift problem is because of the weak signal
but still for my use its not very helpfuli love listening to  inspirational channel
i could not pickup reception on this walkman only a few stations were clear
did not get much use out of this onei attempted to use this for the jvc everio gzhd camera
it didnt work
i couldnt screw it on because the tripod screw was too small
so please be forewarned all hd usersi bought it for the slik monopod i got and it works smoothly quickly and securely
i just used it on a subject in which the light passing through some blinds was creating a great pattern on a large indoor plant leaf
i needed the monopod quickly and the light was fleeting and i already had the quick connect pad attached to my camera so i was able to get it almost immediately
its a bargain for what it does and makes one wonder why all monopods dont come with themupdate  the plastic top for the quick connect pad has partially peeled off
also it does need to be attached with a flat head screwdriver
i wish it were the same size and material as another quick connect i have with a tripod that is rubberized and has held up for decades
this does work but theres no reassuring feeling of security with it while having a heavy camera and lens attached to it
im no longer using it and am simply screwing the slik monopod into the tripod holethe base is not the standard size to go on a tripod
it is a smaller bolt size and will not go on a monopod or sima tripod
i did not return item due to low cost
maybe someday i will have a tripod it will fit
the product description did not say not standard threadone of the speakers had very poor treble response compared to the other  i would guess a fault with something
even the other one sounded really muted compared to a cambridge soundworks outdoor speaker that has weathered  new england wintersput this on a wooden table and the case will mar and scratch your table
not coolits very cheaply made may look professional from a distance but its likely to come apart if it falls of the airport luggage truck
also next time ill buy something without pic foam and just pay to have the foam sculpted
other than that it works
might be good value for the money for someone getting started on photo or video or for someone that needs to carry semiprecious equipment aroundi purchased my minolta dimage hi new  years ago
performance was fine up until two weeks ago when the cameras evf and lcd displays went completely black no images displayed
contacted sony where you now have to go for minolta service as instructed and found that the base flat rate for repair was  plus  shipping
they got me once but they wont get me twicemadmaxim sure when this camera was released back around  it was all the rave
i bought this camera back in july  for  from beach camera
alot of major annoyances with this camera such as the lens cap you have to remember to take it off before you turn the camera on or else you get a message saying to take the cap off and restart the camera
the menu is tedious and cumbersome to work with
the manual settings take too much time
the start up time lags
time between shots lag especially using flash
it can take up to  seconds between shots using flash
you will definately lose alot of good potential shots using this camera
its only a  megapixel camera
that might have been good in  but in  its time to buy a new camera
does not have image stabilization
is is a must in the camera is pretty noisy while focusing
battery usage is very low as is expected with all ps cameras
the included software is pretty much useless in  picture quality is pretty good which is one of this cameras highlights
so in conclusion if you are on a shoe string budget then this is the camera you are going to get
i would not pay more than  used as this camera is over  years old in  dont expect any keeper shots if you need fast recycling time between shots
this camera was state of the art  years ago
not anymorethis is the first digital camera i have ever purchased and i have learned a lot since then avoid cameras where the lens extends outward from the body
these are prone to many problems ranging from impact to debris effecting its performance make sure the camera suits your purpose test it in the store if you can
if you want a camera to capture action this is not the camera for youfor simple snap shots this is not a bad camera for action it is virtually uselessi now have a nikon d which is infinitely superior and worth the extra i have this camera for  years
the image quality is ok optics are good
battery life is good
now  years later cameras have bigger displays but thats not a negative point for this camera as it came out in a time this size was usualthe big bad thing with this camera is its respond time and this really makes the good things pretty useless
it needs about  seconds from the moment i hit the shoot button until it actually takes the picture and i have had so much occasion with peoples where this ruined the take
specially with kids you have a good moment and shoot but the picture is taken long after the good moment passed away
also the time the camera needs to save the image after the take is extremely slow there go other  good moments until the cam is ready again
maybe the save file time can be shortened with a better highspeed flash card the one i use is a standard card
but it will still be too much time to save the image
i am going now purchasing a canon powershot awe just moved into our first house and in the last couple of months ive purchased three brands of bookshelf speakers
in order ive purchased a pair of infinity primus  speakers a pair of small  each on super sale pioneer shflr speakers and now i just opened a pair of bose s i got with my credit card pointsthe first thing i noticed about the bose v speakers was the build quality almost as good as the  pioneers the pioneers dont have exposed particle board the bose speakers do
there are no poststyle connectors just the cheap holeandlever type
the infinity s are built out of much better materials have gold postand screw style contacts removable fronts solid wood construction internal dampening nice feet and wall mounting slotsthe bose vs sound decent for their size but they certainly dont sound as good as the infinity s which are almost half the price
specifically i notice certain midrange tones are exaggerated with the bose s
it is almost as if the cabinets have some resonance frequency that sets off with a certain midtone
the bass response also seems a little uneven with certain bass drum notes showing up loudly but other higher bass guitar notes almost absent
the absence of certain bass notes is probably what bothers me the most
im running a straight amp without any eqi got these speakers with my credit card points and im thinking of selling them on ebay and buying something elsecheck out stereophile for more speaker information they had a good article on the infiniti primus speakersthese speakers arent bad sounding they just are not great speakers
they sound best at low volume
they sound good at less than  watts but not so great above that
bass is weak from these unitsif you want good bose sound at least go with the si got rid of the s and replaced them with sony ssbs which have better bass response and simply sound much better at less than half the pricepeople are very loyal to their brands and bose is no execption
ive owned many different models of higher end bose speakers for many years including the lower end  bookshelf speakers
im about to reitre them as there are too many better speakers out there for the money
the bose speakers are great for people who lack a good ear for music and love a dead sounding speaker meaning the highs arent real high and the mid range is ok but there is more low range
you can adjust your tuner receiver all you want but its tough to really get the bose to come to life like other speakers
i love bose but will retire my  when the new speakers arrivefor less money than the  but with much fuller sound that really comes to lifebose speakers are great for people who lack a trained ear and those stuck in the sif i could give  stars i wouldfirst of all its outrageous for bose to claim that they have high quality parts and assembly when they charge  for speakers that arent even magnetically shieldedthe claim is that these are great for your home system but you have to keep it  feet away from your tv and other electronics because of the magnetism
otherwise your tv will be spewing funny colors on the sides until its degaussed and your computer or console systems might start losing data  or not work altogethersecond of all just look at the construction glued together slabs of plywood actually i think its particle board but im no pro in the back with those cheap wire connectors
if you pay a little bit of attention to detail youll see costcutting measures from many anglestheres a quote for something like this nice from afar but far from nice
at this price its embarrassingthe soundi used these with my home theater system for years
from day one i never felt satisfied
i thought i wasnt setting them up right because everyone talks so lovingly about bose
but no
they never sounded that goodi tried many methods keep it away from the walls for better wide dispersal of sound
i put them close to the wall then slightly farther and farther
i tried placing them in corners of the room at different distances
while some setups were marginally better than others i never once was satisfied with the end resultbass is floppy when it comes to something more than a typical singlenote beat think of a techno bassline
it just kind of flutters all over the place
the mids are decent but the treble kind of fades away and is overwhelmed by the midrangedirectionality is nonexistent
first thing i noticed when i got my new speakers was how i could tell how far an object crashed offscreen and where it would be if it landed in my room
that never happened with these speakers
everything is there but resides nowherei had to blast up my center channel volume in order to be somewhat content with my sound system
ive replaced all my bose products and am never going backthere is a place for these speakersi donated the vs to a friend of mine that owns a bar
he was using the logitech z speakers to play music in a room that was x larger than the speakers were meant to filli put these on the shelf and included a polkaudio cs for the center speaker  and the sound filled up the room much more nicely
it was a great improvementbest of all the speakers are on high shelves away from other electronics
winwinthe positive and there are good things about these speakersheres the best aspect of the vs they are actually good to have for a large room in which you could be sitting in many different places
if its a midsized bar  and they are wired at the far right and far left of the room  it does a good job making everything balanced
the lack of directionality from these speakers is an attribute when there are a wide range of seating options
there are few  if any  dead spots in the bar
plus the passable midrange and low treble keeps it easy to maintain a conversation while still having music on
wherever someone sits they wont be yelling over the volume compared to another spot in the barso for that i give them props
with that said i do not recommend these for home theater use or for music at home if you like a properly dispersed sound fieldid recommend them for about  but you can find better at this price range
in fact almost anything for  would be betterive been using some polk audio tsis driven by a sonos connectamp for about two years
but recently i somehow got the idea that maybe i could get even better sound quality with some bose bookshelf speakers s especially because they have speakers pointed in many directions
the guy at the bose store assured me that some s would definitely fill the room better and give higherquality soundthey did not
the s sound quality was obviously and clearly inferior to my tsis which are smaller perhaps betterlooking and much cheaper
toggling back and forth between the speakers it sounded as if the bose were sitting in a long tunnel trebles and mids were flatter and dullsounding
even if i customtuned my eq for the bose the tsis at the same eq settings still sounded better
its rare that something on the market is priced so inappropriately not sure if its the polk or the bose but it moved me to write this reviewi had expected more from bose after hearing a bose wave radio which for its size produces amazing sound but the s honestly didnt sound that greatif you are looking for something simple that is as easy as most things for windows xp look elsewhere
notice that most of these reviews are from mac userson the pc side there is no easy install like is being claimed here
yes as a geek i figured it out but it was not for the normal people out there
you have to follow instructions
worse the instructions arent easy to find
you have to know to search for the manual on the diskno compatible softwareeven though it mentions that its compatible with all the operating systems it is the software that comes with it for backups does not work on xp
so that leaves you with a hard drive that you need to know how to installif you are looking for something simple this is not it
my low rating is based on installation and setup
i am not knocking it but want you all to be cautious if youre not a geek or mac addicti am running a pentium   ghz with  mb ram
i defragged my drive with diskeeper
still i had audio sync problems and dropped frames
also the captured video even on the best setting was very pixelated compared with the analog source
im returning this and looking to invest in a better product with hardware conversion
you get what you pay fori tried one of these for a long time and have to say that despite all of its features that supposedly make this product so much better the ipod is still vastly superiorpersonally i find the zen rather ugly with a tiny bluegreen screen and that idiotic mousestyle scrollwheel on the side
the front and back are nce and shiny but overall from external appearances i was not impressed
overall it just seems like a strange size and weight and it never quite fits anywhereon to the actual point of owning oneplaying music
in this i can say that the zen has nothing on the ipod
the search feature typing a letter in one at a time by selecting it with the wheel the organization system that just doesnt make sense and the fact that you have to view everything on that little tiny screensure you can put  gb of music on it but i dare you to find one song on that crappy little wheel in half the time it would take me on a  gb ipodi do like that you can make playlists on the actual device but the entire system suffers from far too much needless complexity
everything is too complicated too much relearning
the sides are riddled with buttons none of which have much tactile feedback and trust meif this is in your pocket you wont have much idea which side is which without looking
on my ipod i can change songs raise and lower the volume etc
without even thinking or looking at the device itself
its just a simpler more efficient wayive given the zen  stars for having a large drive a decent appearance certainly better than those horrible archos hunksofjunk and highspeed connectivity
it is a technical masterpiece with the ability to create playlists change eax settings add reverb and speed changes to your music and record but all of this is utterly ruined by its stupid wheel bad organizational system poor screen and needless complexity if you select a song in the list it begins playing but your screen does not change to indicate which song is playingin fact if you scroll for a while you will soon have no clue what song youre playing what song is next etc
until you back all the way out of every menu and go to now playing
by contrast the ipod switches to show the current song and pressing menu lets you select another song or back out the simple threelevelsdeep menu system to get back to now playing
the zens menu system is  to seven levels deep when it could be two or three
im all for ipod competition but the ipod is still the best
get it insteadyou wont regret itwhen i decided to upgrade from my old rio to a gb mp player this is the first one i purchased
not because the reviews were so great but because im a hardcore pc guy who has an aversion to anything apple
i had this thing for about two weeks before returning it to the store
first the necessary cables werent in the box then the zen didnt know how to talk to my dell i had to download some drivers and call customer support finally it would only import  of my songs because the other ones had what the software called quotfatal bit errorsquot even though they played fine on my computer
and trust me i work in it and tech problems are my specialty
i finally got the thing working barely but then i happened to mess around with my girlfriends ipod she has a mac of courseit took me about five minutes to realize the mistake i had made
the ipod is better designed with easier menus and what sounded to my untrained ears like better sound quality
i asked sara how long it took to get the thing working and she looked at me with a blank face
she said all she did was plug it in and boom  thirty minutes later she was good to go
i returned my zen that day picked up the gb ipod and had my cd collection imported within the hour
no bit errors
no driver problems
i kept thinking something must be wrong because i didnt need to do any troubleshooting
the thing works perfect
i dont care what your loyalties are the ipod is the premier unit out there
it costs a little more but save yourself the headache and just get onethis is my th wireless mouse and the only one that ive owned that is sufficiently smooth and accurate for gaming
its also reasonably easy on the batteries
ergonomically its great
just one problem and its a big one
sometimes it just stops working
sometimes reestablishing the connection through the control panel will work sometimes not
sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work sometimes not
sometimes absolutely nothing can be done to get it to work but then the next day it will be working fineif the mouse spirits are kind to you youll love this mouse
if not youll curse itused on a pentium m laptop w vcon h video conferencing software never used logitech software
flawlessly connected to highend polycom  tandberg units  sent impressive video quality
clip on laptop mount is durable and effective extremely portable
image is quite sharp once mushy focus is set
i use headset so no idea how camera microphone sounds
effective face tracking
however after  sessions something failed camera produced only vertical streaks
logitech replaced it freeive tried several notebook webcams and was excited to get the logitech quickcam pro because of the good reviews but i must say im very disappointed with the webcam and will be returning it for the creative ultra webcam for notebooksthe main problem is the design to attach it to your notebook screen
the hinge is so weak that the webcam just flops over and is always pointed at the ceiling or above your head
on the box they show the webcam securely fitted to the screen and it never sat that securely on my hp dv or dell d screenson the plus side i liked the image quality and the builtin microphone
but those highlights are negated by the fact that its very difficult if not impossible to even get the camera pointed in the right directionmy suggestion is to try to find a notebook webcam that fits securely on to your screen eg
creative ultrai wanted a better set of headphones so i purchased a set of bose triport headphones at the best buy store in sioux falls sd
the sound the triports produced was very good but they only lasted about four months until late one night the left ear cup literally fell apart in my hands
my electronic equipment is very important to me i do not treat it rough or abuse it in any way the triports just disintegrated
my first warning should have been the broken bose display headphones at the best buy store because mine fell apart in exactly the same spot where they were broken
on the positive side the people at the bose store at the mall of america were great they replaced the triports with no questions asked even though i did not buy the headphones in their store
in fact i used the old triports as a down payment on the bose quiet comfort  headphones
i really love the sound the quiet comfort s produce but you know what 
i recently noticed a piece of plastic broken out of the left head band support  uh oh 
bose headphones produce very good sound but they are fragile like eggshellsi bought these headphones after hearing them at a bose store in a shopping mall
i hadnt had anything much to compare them to except earphones that come with portable players and they sound much better than that
however you can get the same or better sound from headphones that cost far less
i recently bought a pair of sennheiser px  headphones to take to the gym they are also more comfortable
the bose triports have a flimsy plastic headband which has broken three times in nine months
bose cheerfully replaced them each time but i now must use the headphones gingerly and after hearing the sennheiser px  i prefer to use the sennheiser
the bose sound nice but you can get better value for your money elsewhere
bose did however introduce me to better sounding headphones
i just wish i had done some comparison shopping before i plopped down my money for the bose headphonesjust because its a bose you tend to think that they sound better
indeed if you go to a bestbuy store where there is lot of ambient noise and try these haedphones you perceive it to sound better
but return home and then compare them with other cheaper headphones and you will find that the bose is not tremendous after alli listened with these headphones for  weeks and returned them because i eventually found that i got more satisfaction from the cheaper sennheiser hd  headphone for which i had paid only  at amazon whereas the bose cost me almost  including taxesso please dont go just by brand name
trust your ears and not your eyes because you are going to listen through your ears and not eyes
forget the bose symbol on your headphone and compare them to any other headphone that you previously own
they will sound as good
dont waste your money on this productthe audio is too loud
the treble is too high pitching and almost pains your ears after some time
the bass is reduced thats the reason it does not blur even at high volumes
overall mediocre soundi listened to these and the bass is way too deepfeels like youre gonna fry your earseven if you set the bass to the middle it still sounds like badtrust me if you want a great product from this company just buy the wave radio youll be much happierit is almost indistinguishable from my expensive sony stereo and the speakers sound just as good if not better than my ssmbh bookshelf speakersthat is a high peak in technology and worth the moneythese headphones are horrible thoughi like the sound fine but the headphones have a couple of ways of breaking where the overthehead plastic joins the ushaped yoke attached to the earpiece and where the earpiece mount pivots in the overthehead plastic
theyre just too cheaply and flimsily made
nothing like seeing  bite the dust just because of some broken thin plastic partsi bought my triports when they first came out
i listen to them every day at work and within the first week i broke both sides
i called bose and they said they hadnt had any problems but told me to return
i did and the second pair did the same thing
a little scotch tape and they worked fine for over a year
now i just snapped off the left ear piece
maybe i have a big head but i definitely dont abuse these headphones to a point where they should break so easily
great sound bad engineering
next headphones will definitely not be the triportsi deleted my original star review
i know this particular model is no longer available but if my experience is any indication you should think hard before buying a toshiba laptop especially a lowerend model
i had the satellite s for three years  during the first year i had it it blew a hard drive thankfully under warranty
i had it fixed and less than a week later it blew another hard drive
this time it went back to toshiba to be fixed
all was more or less well for the next two years when a windows problem shut the thing down completely
i took my data out of it and switched back to a mac
i am sick of windows unreliability susceptibility to viruses and other problems and the maskingtapeandchewinggum nature of patching together windows machines just in order to make them function
but  more to the point the computer had inherent problems first and foremost being the cheap desktop processor toshiba uses or used in their lowerend laptops
this machine got incredibly hot and i was told this is probably what killed my first  hard drives
if you have one of these machines i highly recommend a cooling platform which is probably the only thing that kept my laptop running for an additional  years
its a shame because aside from being very heavy and having a weak battery charge  hours at best this laptop was attractive and easy to use with a nice bright display
but ultimately  not a good value  at  i dont consider it a cheap machine by any means and certainly not when compared to my less expensive ibooki order this one over the metal one to save five bucks
i figured i didnt need a great one to look at the moon
but  wish i would have paid the few bucks extra
the plastic threads are uneven and its very difficult to screw in the the eyepiece evenly
it feels like the whole plastic body was deformed from heatjust pay the extra five bucks and get the metal onei bought this for the celestron astromaster  which is only good for lunar observation
i found that the filter darkens the moon too much and details are lost
i feel better viewing without the filterits even worse if you use a x barlow lense i also boughti own this camera and while it was very good in  the years have passed it by
there are other cameras with more megapixels faster response time better battery life lighter weight better lens etc
plus they cost the same or less than this camera is advertised for here
i still use it because i bought the waterproof case up to ft depth
and i use that regularly
you can probably find used ss for way less than the prices here if you really want itwhat i ran it on my computer was a mhz amd mb ram mb ati radeon running winse with an atampt broadband internet connectionthe install the installation appeared to go without a hitch
if you dont follow the very specific instructions that the software provides then you will probably run into problemsthe picture the picture on the quickcam messenger was surprisingly good
the friend i was having a video chat with through yahoo messenger had a webcam from a different vendor that cost about half as much and her picture quality was consistently poorthe framerate while recording a video to my hard drive the framerate was more than adequate
over the internet was another story but i question whether any other webcam could have done betterreliability this is where everything goes bad
in the  minutes i spent videochatting with my friend i had to reboot my computer more than  times
even when i wasnt broadcasting images over the internet and simply stared at myself on my desktop the camera or software consistently locked up
the software provided is loaded with bugs and merrily installs itself everywhere on your computer quickstart toolbar desktop program menu
i finally gave up on the camera after  days of trying to get it to work reliably updating drivers and such and returned it
my guess is the camera works great but the software was thrown together as an after thought
after uninstalling the software my computer has never been the same
i can no longer play windows media files and i can no longer run graphic intensive applications
i ended up having to reformat my harddrive i used this as an opportunity to install windows xp  is outdated now anywaysannoyances if you bought a monitor and the monitor manufacturer said quotyou need to subscribe to a rd party service in order to view the internet through your new monitorquot i bet youd be pretty annoyed
well that is essentially what logitech did when they teamed up with spotlife
you can use the webcam to broadcast video over messenger services such as msn messenger icq yahoo etc but if you want to broadcast live video from your computer to a web host as a browser accessible nannycam or something then youll need to do so through spotlife
spotlife gives you a free trial period of course but the freedom of doing what you want with the streaming images generated on your computer has been taken away from yousummary i waited a week after returning my quickcam messenger before i wrote this review
i knew that i should let my emotions cool down a little so i could try to write something informative and objective
the webcam may have performed reliably on a system with a different os and some people might like the idea of spotlife its actually a good idea for people that cant write html
if you can buy it from someplace with a flexible return policy then give it a whirl just have your os cd handy for the install and for when you need to reformat your harddrive after the uninstallthe bottom line i will be buying another webcam but im going to avoid products by logitech
thats too bad because i used to really like logitechi agree with whoever said too much software installed
i prefer plug and play no hassle
i also think the image is awful and i have a pretty good computer system
it had static on image and just did not look clear at all
my  year old quickcam had a nice picture so i expected this to be nice alsono luckalso the box says mac compatible which i thought was cool since i have  systems winxpmac and then i get home go to support website  see its not for mac
huh
in any case this was returned and im getting something differenti got it to work on xp but never in vista
it always tells me that i need a new driver despite just loading it
it seems like it doesnt see it
so the bottom line is drivers can not be loadedcold eyesi bought this along with a new olympus camera for all the obvious reasons faster downloading
im not that enamoured with itthe good downloading is definitely faster than from the camera its portable so i can use it on any of my pcs or laptops i didnt have too many issues making it workthe bad bad driver still not xp certified
id expect olympus to have their act together in this regard wouldnt work with my in floppy drive card reader ive had to disable that on my pc to get this to work doesnt like moving pictures  will only copy and then i have to manually delete the pictures through file manager or the camera i think it is slow plugged into a usb  and transfer rates are well below par
it takes about  seconds to download a single shqjpg picture about mbi personally would opt for something else eg
a multi reader with xp certified drivers before getting this card readerhappy shoppingjbive only been into astronomy for  months now but even for me this set is a bit too entry level quality wise
however i can see the value of this kit to some users because it does come with so many accessories that could be useful at a really inexpensive pricei already have two luminous eyepieces and opted to get this kit to round out my collection
however the image quality is very poor in comparison to what i already have so i opted not to keep this kitthe mm eyepiece did not show any signs that it was low quality the image was good
however for the higher magnification pieces the image was never as clear as i wantedthe color filters are ok definitely acceptable for the pricei really liked the case the most it is well made and has room for other pieces you may havethe price point is very appealing for this product but i believe the optics of the eyepieces may hold back your telescope from giving you the best image possiblei ordered this knowing full well that celestron lenses werent the greatest in the world but this was still a little disappointing
when using these lenses in my telescope all of the images were quite blurry no matter which lens i used
the filters were less than impressive as well
my yellow filter arrived with a very noticeable scratch through the middle that makes it nearly worthless for using with the telescope
also the foam insert for my case does not match the one in the description and did not include space to store my own lenses and that was one of the factors for me that lead to my decision to buy this
buyer beware this looks like a great deal up front but the quality of these lenses and filters is quite sub parseveral  lenses have specks of debris on the inside of the eyepiece
i dont feel comfortable disassembling the eyepiece to clean then howeveri recently bought a new celestron nexstar se telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit
much to my disappointment the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope and when cold nights in colorado are f the eyepieces did not fit at allcelestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised
when i called a second time they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem
amazon replaced the kit thank you amazon
 but the replacements did not fit either
im returning that kit too
i finally bought a kit from meade  eyepieces and a moon filter that fit properly and are very easy to useto be fair if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value hence the rating of  stars rather than 
the meade kit is a worse value but because they work in my nice new scope they are the best for anyone using a nexstar sei recently received the e
i am a palm user but was seduced by a  amazon rebate and a  toshiba rebate
at approximately  net how could you lose on this  mb thin machine
well i lost
on day three the machine started to freeze
i rebooted once and had to reinstall everything
and then  minutes later it happened againwhen it worked i loved it
unfortunately it was a very short love afairworks perfectly  just like my  generic audio cables
dont pay extra for monsters marketingi had always thought that monsters thx cables were the way to go since the technical specs were better then generic cables but i was wrong
i have  pairs of these thx cables and ever pair has some hiss and mild noise that i can hear in the background
i believe these are only single shielded so that could be a problem
i also have the optical thx cable and that does the same thing
the only pair that doesnt hiss is the higher end monsters that i bought which i beleive at the time were the monster s
now i am not telling you to go out and pay bucks for a cable
that is a huge waste of moneyin fact i discovered monoprice which has much better prices then monster and i believe better cables
blue jean is also good but they are still a bit pricey
hands down unless you are paying top dollar for monsters highest end cables you are getting only a slightly better cable then a generic
go with monoprice or try belkin as belkin used double shielding and monoprice makes some cables with triple shieldingi thought id get these guys to see what all the hubub was about but found myself disappointing
i felt silly after buying them because i didnt notice a difference in qualitypros it workscons they are so bulky and thick that my tv mounted on the wall will not angle down enough because they stick out of the back so far
you need a solid few inches of clearance from the plug
this is a problem if you need to have it close to the wall or need to loop them up from the bottom
big issue for no gain and higher price
this bulk is completely unnecessaryi have a wired and wireless networked soho
i used the ns to replace a netgear  hub that was working fine
the reason for the upgrade is that a month ago i developed a need for large file transfers from  computers that were plugged into my hub going down one cat wire to my server room to a nas box
the problem was the hub was getting almost constant collisions when id try and communicate with the nas simultaneously on more than one computer on the hub
so i thought swapping the hub out with this switch would solve the problem i also had  other nas boxes off the hub and a printerwhile the ns switch took care of the data collision issue ive actually seen my network file transfer to the remote nas box decrease versus the hub i had been using
the worst problem im encountering with the ns is that its method of throttling multiple computers trying to use the same pipe appears to be to dedicate virtually all the bandwidth to the first computer that tries to access the remote nas box
wtf
that doesnt solve my problem it makes it worse
now the situation i end up with is if i try and access the remote nas with more than one pc at a time the nd and following pc connections hang
not only that but those machines can barely if at all access the internet or anything else since the data connection needs to travel from the switch across the same pipe to the server roomi am going to experiment with running at least one more cat line from the gs to my server room to see if that helps but at this point i am very skeptical
im annoyed that i cant change the behavior of the switch and that it appears to be optimized to favor a single connection to the switch communicating with a single other connection on the switch
what i wanted was a device that would load balance like my hub but more intelligently handle the traffic in an effort to avoid data collisions like what i was seeing on the hub
yet what i have now with the gs is worse
i didnt get timeouts and apps crashing with the hub just slower throughput for all connected devices
but that is better than what i have right now which paralyzes part of my network when a large transfer is initiated from any one device on the switch
very annoying and counterproductiveim now looking at the tplink giga switches which are the only brand ive found so far that supports  transfer rates on all ports for the pricedisclaimer  im already bitter about netgear because i owned a wgt wireless router and the thing would literally die and need to be reset every two weeks
but i was told netgears prosafe products are better theyre more professionalgrade and they just work
well ha
i bought this gse unmanaged plus switch a month ago
let me tell you as an unmanaged switch it works
i connected it to my router and then plugged in my roku xbox and bluray player and viola theyre connected to my network
so it does its basic job okay at leastbut i wanted more than that
this thing promises network monitoring vlans and bandwidth control
supposedly it can give you that if youre running an older version of windows
instead of a webbased interface like most modern devices this thing requires you to use windowsbased software that only works on older versions of windows
all i have in my home now is win bit and mac osx and administration software isnt available for either of them
the netgear website called netgear product compatibility for microsoft windows  doesnt mention this router at all if that tells you anything
while trying to learn how to operate this thing i learned about other unpleasant quirks it has
apparently it uses udp for administration login and broadcasts your login unencrypted across your entire network
if you dont know why this is bad then you dont need a router with extra features anyway go buy the cheapest unmanaged router you can find instead
that brings me to my conclusion  while this switch works on a basic level its perfect for nobody
if you dont need extra features and just want an unmanaged switch get a cheaperbutbetter one from someone like asus or buffalo
if you do want a switch with extra management and monitoring features you should buy one with a webbased interface so you never get screwed on lack of os support
netgear makes one the gst but it costs more and im not sure ill trust netgear again for a long time anywaybought  of these and they both worked for a day
nd day one started getting flakey
works for about  minutes after power cycling
im not a happy camper
these felt much heftier than my previous dlink  switches
not much good if they dont work
im going to return one under warranty and hopefully the new one works
i need  more but i wont buy any more netgear products until i get more satisfaction
buy with cautionperformanceiperf mbsec  source linux lenny celeron d  broadcom netxtreme bcmiperf mbsec  source winxp sp p ghz intel proreliabilityout of  netgear gs line switches ive had  fail outright and one requires reboots gs isolated for iscsi
one requires a reboot every few months gs switches at a different site
one failed such that all of the link lights flash at the same time network drops each time completely unusable
power cycle doesnt help
power it off and unplug it for an hour and it will work for  minutes
it took  months to fail but i had swapped it in the middle with the working switch during a facilities moveone gs uplinked to a jgs and used to feed the back office pcs and laptops failed the same as the one gs failure above
this is in a different city than the gs
this worked fine for  monthsone gs which works fine after  years but is not left on fulltimeone jgs bigger case has heat sinks and fans works fine for several yearsall switches have plenty of ventilationwarrantythe retail versions have a lifetime warranty but crossship is 
the jgsxx switches with fan seem to be much more reliable
alternatively for half the cost i picked up atrendnet port unmanaged gigabit greennet standard switch  x mbps
its been running solid for  years now as has a port im using elsewhere
these are pretty close to the size of the netgear half the cost and the status leds are on the front with all wires going out the backwhile the netgear has lifetime warranty thats quickly negated by shipping costs for replacement
the trendnet has a year warranty which is pretty decentsummarystay away from these gs models
the gsxx line seems to have a  failure rate after  months of poweron time
for twice the cost netgear has a larger fancooled version jgsxx
trendnet has a better product for half the costi had two of these fail within a year or two
i was too lazy to pursue any sort of warranty repairreplacement
i wouldnt buy this product again
instead i now usehp procurve switch g port  gigabit network switchwhich has been flawlessi really like this device when i first got it because it was a plug and go device
however  months later one of the ports has failed
none of the devices i plug into this port work on that port but they work on the other ports
the warranty is only  days and i will now need to get another devicei purchased the netgear gs to replace a gigafast  switch to speed up backups from our home gigabit enabled pcs to our nas network attached storage devices
well it was a disappointment from second my dsl router just rebooted continually and i suffered from local broadcast storms
i am using a proline dsl router from my local carrier
wireshark showed the broadcast traffic was being switched erratically thus its continuancei called netgear tech support very bad
they asked just a few basic questions and then said my unit was faulty and that it should be returned
lucky for me that amazon has a great return policy i really appreciated that
 stars because of thatmy son advised me to purchase an hp procurve switch g
bless his nerdy heart
well i did and it has worked flawlessly
available via amazon for a similar price
lifetime warranty too amazing for a device like this
it is working flawlesslyof course your mileage may vary
many people seem to like the netgear product and thats why i purchased it initiallyi should also add that the gigabit switch update has shortened my backups to  minutes from  not badnicely boxed and wellconstructed but it wouldnt function in my network because it wont passthrough dhcp requests
this causes devices to use apipa automatic private internet protocol addressing which ends up being on a different subnet and unreachablemy network is nothing special
it goes from cable modem to ooma voip to apple extreme dhcp server to this switch
my tenyearold asante worked like this and when it failed i replaced it with the gs
suddenly nothing in the switch worked
when i plugged my mac into the switch i noticed it had a selfassigned ip address on a different subneti didnt bother contacting netgear because i know their support is marginal
you can search their website and find many buyers asking about the same problem and all were responded to like it was their fault and their network setup was wrongsomething interesting i noticed is that most port switches i looked at in this price range looked similar
in fact many of them even had the same model number gs so i concluded theyre all made by the same company and would have the same problem
so i spent a little more money and bought an hp switch with poea couple more things i noticed which arent important but indicates old technology
who needs a mb led
most connections are mb although i have a couple of old devices that are mb but on this unit theres not gigabit led
you have to look for a  and  and do the math
ever hear of a multicolor led
also theres no poe provision builtinconnected to linksys e router
no gigabit connection
wth
works at mbps
but its for the living room and maxes out
idea was to have a gigabit link to the computer room
not worth the extra  from a fast ethernet switchthis was unable to power the ir emitters on a camera at the end of a  foot run ran fine in daylight but no lights at night
this was with two other outdoor cameras on  foot runs
sent it back and put my older non gig poe switch in service
i dont know if the issue is power  watts should have done it or the algorithm that determines power based on cable lengthi bought this switch on amazon almost a year ago and it has performed flawlessly
however it has one big detractor its loud
one would assume the problem is the fan being too loud but thats not it well not entirelyi did some testing with three different xxmm v fans and the results are a bit surprising
turns out the underlying issue here isnt the fans db levels but the transmission of the vibration through the switchs chassis
yes the stock fan was the loudest of the three the lowest db fan tested was rated at db but not by much
if you run each fan separate from the unit each is actually pretty quiet
it is not until the fan is places in the chassis that the noise becomes apparent
since we know the fans themselves arent loud they are actually pretty quiet we can then assume that the noise being generated is due to the transmission of the fans vibration through the chassis
the various fans tested didnt change the db level much but the pitch would vary slightly per unit
i simply found a pitch that wasnt as noticeablethe real solution to this problem would be to isolate the fans from the chassis more
it seems as if older units used twin xxmm fans which likely didnt produce as much vibration but were louder in db as the mm variants do
without hacking things up i dont really see a simple solution to this issue on the current single fan version
i could potentially see trying to use a single xxmm fan isolating it from the chassis with some rubber and add a little ducting to the egress
fyi the stock fan flows cfm
i may try messing with this again at a later date but for now its not a high enough priority since the switch is located in a networkserver closet anyway
that said if i listen as i walk past the room the closet is in i can still hear the switch humming even with the closet door closed
in the end it is a great switch if you are just needing an unmanaged gigabit switch
update the switch worked well for a while unfortunately it failed after about  months of use in a very low demand environment
by low demand i mean x actual users x computers  used at a time at most and x pss used primarily as media renderers
switch was also powered via a ups with voltage regulation in a ventilated network closet
i wound up replacing the switch with a cisco sg which has significantly more features and time and again has proven to be much more reliable and well worth the difference in pricethe unit works fine i havent ever had functional issues with it
it gets quite hot  be sure to use the rubber feet and dont pack them too tightly
there is no fan
however netgear warranty service is now quite bad
one of these units two years old just died on me
we spent two hours being bounced from one person to another our call got dropped three times
 we will have to pay for shipping the dead unit in and at the very very end it turned out that they were out of stock for replacements and would not issue an rma until they got it back in stock
in other words just sit around keep calling back we cant even send in the dud until they are good and readyi think next time ill try another vendorif you do decide to buy this unit consider buying two
you may not get a bad one replaced in a timely fashionthis is in response to the netgear port gseeditupdate  spelling errorsdoes the job once its setup
however netgear ships this switch with software that only runs on windows and without a static ip address
the switch is shipped such that it is expecting to receive its ip from an existing dhcp servernetgear  if youre going to sell managed network devices please do not make assumptions about how or where the product is going to be used
if someone is looking for a dropin solution they arent going to be buying a managed switchyoure marketing this as a business solution
it isnt the s anymore
business networks use more than windows
again its a managed switch
getting started should be as simple as      see manual for configuration optionsafter having to waste a bit of time the switch is setup and it works as expected
i have  more port switches i need to buy for a small business and they will not be netgear products
it will be cheaper and less trouble to buy a more expensive cisco switches that can be unboxed and setup without having to install software and ensure network prerequisites are present
 pros solid build  heavy for its size which is excellent if placed on a desktoponce setup it moves packets tofrom devices as expectedspace efficienthas good rubber feet if you leave this on a deskseems to run cool to the touch cons windowsonly setup software i cant stress how frustrating this isconfiguration utility requires installation of rd party softwareships without an ip address its a network device you cant connect to out of the boxno problem setting it up performance was fine the case is durable
however it just up and died after  years of use
maybe thats par for the course but its the most expensive switch on my network so im not impressed
im replacing it with a dlink port gigabit i already have one of those and its still going stronghad trouble with it connecting the ps just wouldnt work so i brought the cheaper version by treadnet and it works great
why spend more for a name and less portsi thought this was a really good switch
it had all the good features for a pretty reasonable price and it runs at gigabyte speed
i bought mine in feb  and in aug it quit
they sent me a brand new unit and then that one quit in nov i am now waiting for my second replacement uniti have to say that netgears customer care people are quite cooperative and they replace their defective products right away without an argument
but i have to wonder what it going on with this product
if this third unit quits i think ill just find another switch and call it eventhe irony of it is that this thing replaced a really cheap plastic netgear port switch that i bought at a store for 
that switch has lasted quite a few years  in fact im running on it now
it works perfectlyps if youve done much research you know that the gs has a lot of features that the other switches in this price category lack
my advice is to first find out if netgear has fixed the problem i refer to and if you can satisfy yourself that they have go ahead and buy itadded sep   the thing died on me
i dont know how they can keep replacing these under warranty with the same unit that has the same problem
threw this unit in the trash and bought a dlinki had to buy this product for college and we used it to of course design homes
it is the stupidest thing in the world
first off it takes up like gb of hard drive space
you have to have gb of ram to load a picture
it is so slow and eats so much speed and space on your computer because of all the little furniture and plants and features etc that you will want to punch your monitor anytime you get a little ways into creating something
the more detail you add the slower this thing gets to do anything even save or openif you are designing dog houses this is your product
if you want to try and hang windows and doors on multiple levels of a designed house forget it
they are all mathematically calculated in a way that you will always be adding electrical outlets and doors on the first floor or basement when you meant to put them upstairs
it doesnt know where you are and you wont realize until you see that the whole houses windows and doors and outlets and fans and furniture and staircases are all in the basement
dont buy ita couple of years ago i bought home design software from punch software and gave up on it after a few days of trying to figure out how to use it
and im very technical and generally good with new software
i would not recommend this software unless you really have the time to spend figuring it outgoogle recently released a free home design software
much like other google products this one is very easy to use  although not as powerful as one you might purchase
before buying i strongly recommend you check out googles offering
visit sketchupgooglecom to take a lookwe watch our backyard birds with a pair of binoculars but these do not focus for either of us
sent back and ordered the adjustable focusmistake  i originally bought the combo so i could sync my pda since its a bluetooth device but ms doesnt include the required bluetooth profiles
mistake  even though the keyboard and mouse have great designs the ms bluetooth transceiver can not function properly with any other bluetooth transceiver on the computer system
so buying a bluetooth usb adapter from another company and installing it will not work its either the microsoft transceiver or a competing company or neither  however bluetooth profiles for the keyboardmouse combo are not included with competing companies bluetooth usb adapterstoo make a long story short at this time a decision to have a bluetooth wireless keyboardmouse combo or a different bluetooth usb adapter to allow syncing of pdas and other devices must be made
you can not have both
while installing both devices will work initially eventually the wireless connection will be lost and more time will be spent unstalling and reinstalling the combo than actually using it
mama miahits very simple if you want a great wireless desktop solution but dont give a hoot about bluetooth connectivity this is the product for you
if you want to ever connect to anything else via bluetooth dont even think about iti have done hours of googling looking for a solution to this problem but have come up with the same result everywhere i go the microsoft bt dongle is virtually useless outside of communicating with the mouse and keyboard and maybe a printer
it seems that many people have had to buy a bt dongle from a rd party and throw away the microsoft donglei feel extremely betrayed by microsofts claims of connectivity with this setup
i just bought a sony ericsson t with bt and cant use it with my computer
if you want to connect a phone dont buy this productstraight out of the box i had no trouble installing the keyboard to my sony vaio laptop but the mouse could not be installed without uninstalling my touchpadscrew that
the keyboard worked for a few days then the computer forgot who the keyboard was
every time i tried to rerecognize the keyboard it caused my laptop keyboard to turn off and a system restore to a prebluetooth desktop time was the only way to get it back
it never recognized the keyboard again
i was able to find my tungsten pda with the transceiver but once found and authenticated there was nothing that could be done with it unless confirming that it exists is important to you
after completely removing all vestiges of this product from my computer and starting anew in hopes that the thing would work like it did the first time it still did not work
finally i installed it on my dell desktop computer
had no trouble authenticating the mouse but the wizard for the keyboard would not work
after much frustration and tinkering long into the night i discovered that you could go in to the control panel and click on wireless link in printers and other hardware and search for the keyboard
once found choose this device does not require authentication and it will work fine
so far i have had no further issues but i am terrified every time i sit down that i will end up engaged in another hours long struggle with my computer
i am going to buy the logitech rf wireless setup for my laptop
i hear its a breeze to set upthis device only supports a baset network
i just bought this unit and might have to return it unless i can figure out a way to make it workodd that a unit that relies on the network to receive music would not support mb networks
the more bandwidth the better i say
not likely to sell into any business that has mb only
id consider this a mistake and one that i did not expect in a network appliance at this time in networking where practically everything supports  based networkssurprised and not impressed with that limitationsomething that should be fixed in any future versionthis is a very well constructed cable and is probably one of the best minitorca y cables
however i have found the sound from the ipod to the receiveramplifier to be very low much much lower than the signal from a cd player  of the cd output loudness
this forces you to turn the sound level way up both on the ipod and on the receiveramplifier consuming lots of battery power on the ipod
if you have a low power receiveramplifier you may not be able to play it loud enough
the sound quality is adequate but not great as one can expect for this type of y cable regardless of build quality
i also purched the nyco ipod stereo link for comparison and the sound quality is much better with a much louder output volume x louder than the monster minitorca cable
the nyco is also more power efficient as it drains much less power from the ipod
it does not go through the minijack and also bypasses the volume control a good sign if you care about sound qualityif you dont need to recharge your ipod while you play though the cable to a receiveramplifier i would definitely go with the nyco stereo link cable
i am an audiophile enthusiast with quite a bit of experience in highend audioi have had trouble with both mini plug and rca plugs
they are too large to use with my mp player and my receiver
they plug in part way and the connections are not tight enough to use
i think it is due to the large cable sizethis is an extremely thick cable for rca audio
it looks very durable but noticeably colored the sound with a loss of treble
i was connecting an echo indigo sound card through the line out to a little dot mk v headphone amp
stuck with the stock minirack to rca adapter that came with the echo indigo and sound was much better
it may be that if you have an exceptionally powerful lineout you wont experience a treble rolloff but i sure didthe sound isnt great but adequate for my purposes  using them at the gym
the headband and ear pieces do not fit especially wellbut dont expect much more
the earpads are hard to adjust to your ears
one or the other keeps slipping forward or backward or downward
the headband is very comfortable
the sound is just okay
and who thought that the huge volume controller was such a good idea
really
the controller is jumbosized  just like something out of the sthe left speaker blew out after a short while
return window is only  days thought id share my painthis is one headphone that gets great reviews i got them but was underwhelmedi dont regret purchasing them for the sale price around  bucksbut more than that i dont really think its a great value  should be the regular priceid rate it stars if the volume control casing were conic instead of squared and if it were foldable and folded flat and still foldable being like the sennheiser pxfolding flat being like the jvc flat line of similar headphonestheres nothing spectacular about themsound quality is sufficient but its not impressive
actually after listening to these for hours and putting on the has by jvcthe jvc ha is significantly clearer
listening to these the ktxpro is muddymuffled as if the sound is coming through a blanket or closed windownot any better sony jvc or panasonic headphones around the same price or cheaper if these are being sold anywhere near msrpbuild quality its all plastic with this silicone band stretchy thing at top which i dont know what it doesbuild quality feels a bit cheapthey dont fold up to a more compact space saving form or fold up flat for travel and stuffthe most impressive thing about these was the packaging
its a big pretty box instead of a small blister packthe volume control thing on the cord is completely idiotic who designed this thing
all it does is get smashed and caught in everything and get in the way you cant reposition it or detach it
and its this boxy thing instead of being curved up top conic and bottom so it gets caught in stuff like under a table then you move your head up and chaos ensueslean forward against the table and the slider slides itself downso decent buy but not impressed didnt live up to expectations after reading reviewsi had an old black pair of koss headphones that i loved
the sound was clear distinct and true to the recording
and they werent some ultrafancy expensive pro set just something youd find at walmart etc
i prolonged that sets life for as long as i could but eventually they fell apart beyond repairupon seeking out a proper replacement i thought why not go with the same brand
whatever equivalent product they have out now could only have improved over the years right
but no i guess its true what they say they dont make em like they used to
i got this pair in january 
im still using them reluctantly today
i guess i cant say theyre terrible but what a drop in quality
my old koss were extremely light and comfortable and fit well
this new set really starts to hurt my earlobes after  minutes or so
the sound is pretty muddy especially the bass which is needlessly overdriven making most songs just sound unbalanced
they just feel cheap on the wholethe sound quality is pretty good but these headphones are not loud
even with the players volume and the headphone volume switch all the way up it is not loud enough for me
thats probably due to the onear rather than inear design that im used to with buds
also if youre hoping for something to drown out noise this is not for you
i hope they work for me on the airplane to drown out white noise but im skeptical that they will
also those around you can easily hear what you are listening to
i wouldnt buy them again
you get what you pay for rightdecent for listening to music etc
but i wish i had saved my money and just bought a higher quality headphone set soonermy husband has had a pair of these for many years and really likes them so i ordered a pair to use with my ipad for use on airplane trips
i think the quality has deteriorated since my husbands purchase but they are adequate
i forgot to take into account the noise volume of the jet engines when flying so i had to have the volume on max to hear
these are okay for listening to speech as opposed to music in a quiet environment
they feel flimsy
they are not especially comfortable although i wore them continuously for  hours on a couple of cross country flights
i definitely will upgrade before i fly againi really wanted to like these headphones
theyre distinctively dorky cheapish and sound awesome
unfortunately they also hurt my ears a lot
i kept them for two weeks in hopes that i would be able to break them in but its no use
theyre going back to amazon tomorrowthese are some of the bettersounding entrylevel headphones ive sampled with crisp treble decent bass and good allaround balance and tonal neutrality
and even though differences tend to be subtle among basic headphones you can still tell this is an american product for american tastes the sound is just a little punchier and more pleasing than say your average sony or jvc which sound flat to meunfortunately american also applies to the build quality as the left half of my set just died after only five months of gentle use  a frequent occurrence judging by the comments around here
worse the lifetime limited warranty is limited indeed because koss wont help out unless you mail in a  check
thats pretty ludicrous knowing its their product that failed and dishonest since at that price theyre actually making a profit on your repair
at that point its more rational to just buy a new one which is probably the ideayeah i know the price tags tempting but do a little math over five years is it smarter to spend  for even the most overpriced sennheisers or blow  on ten pairs of theseafter using koss products for years i am disappointed
first the headband was too big so it did not fit on my ear right
if that was not bad enough then there is the sound
the lows and highs are good but the midrange is weak
the vocals sound like they are in the background and are almost muffled at times
the cheap koss clipons sound better
this headphone just makes koss look and sound bad
dont waste your moneytitanium means very light weight
these are light
sound is ok but you have to press them against your ears to get full sound
also i am not bald so the phones keep slipping off my head
i use them for my ipod
its a good thing im sitting instead of jogging
i suppose for the price they are ok but id rather spend a few dollars more and get a heavier headset
i did buy a more expensive pairthe sound of these headphones has too little treble and too much bass
you feel like you are seated in the bass section of the orchestra and can hardly hear anything but the basses
i much prefer my sony fontopia mdrexlp earbuds which have plenty of bass but it is not overpoweringthe sound quality is good for headphones of this size and price
the problem i have with them is that the earcups dont rest flat over the ears
the angle of the earcups isnt right so after awhile that part of each ear that receives more of the contact of the earcups begins to hurt
ive never had this problem with headphones before so i dont think my head or ears etc is anything out of the ordinary
ive had cans that were too tight on my ears but i dont remember the earcup angle being the problem
i previously used similar cansone from this same manufacturer and another from a different maker both of which i wanted to replace with these new units since they the old ones had a lot of miles on them and the sound quality was gone but the earcups on both of those units rest perfectly flat on my ears
i put them on again to confirm it
i prematurely ordered two sets of these cans and the earcups are the same on bothresting at an angle as opposed to flat on my earsi prefer this style of lightweight headphones but these are uncomfortable because the earcups dont rest flat on my ears so i have to order something else
the sound quality is good and the volume is better louder than my older units but since they become a bit uncomfortable after about an hour or so well theyre no good for mepower button got stuck and had to return it for a refund
prior to that i liked it just finethe headpiece is way too tall and not adjustable
that soft band does nothing to help it fit closer to the head
it must have some sort of afterthought to try to make them fit but it didnt work
the ear pieces themselves might have been good had it not been for the fitdid not fit my head properly  the speakers hit just below my ears even adjusted to the smallest size
if your head is average or above average size should be finereceived these today and wore them for  hours straight i usually go  hours or more with my current headphones
my ears are so very sore now
the ear pieces are very small and the design causes them to poke out from your head instead of angle and curve to your earsince they dont fit about my ears the sound is actually pushed away from them causing a canned effect
im not an audiophile by any means so sound quality has never been a big whoop to me but this canned effect along with being able to hear the ambient noise around me is quite annoyingbecause i have a small head the actual head portion of the phones is also a problem for me
after a few minutes they just slide down my face and im constantly adjusting them
even adjusted to the smallest configuration they are still too big for me
and dance with them on
forget about iti mainly got this to use the volume control knob
it works perfectly fine
too bad the rest of the phones are an uncomfortable painful fiti found these to be very uncomfortable and the fit is odd
they just feel wierd
sound quality is decent and for the price theyre okay
i would not buy againthese headphones fit my head fine but the sound is awful
from previous reviews i was expecting something that was of a bit better quality
they were inexpensive and look like they are made well but the sound quality makes them almost unusablethese are some pretty averagesounding headphones
the cool thing that i liked about them was the volume control on the cable
however it was entirely uncool when the volume control shorted out
we didnt mistreat these things
we use them while walking on a treadmill and theres never any stress put on the cable
through typical use of the volume control it has proven that it wasnt wellmade
listen when you have to twist and squeeze the volume control several different ways just to get sound to come back on in both ears  failnicely designed good sound comfortable very reasonable price
just what i was looking for
however the point at which the wire enters the  mm plug head repeated bending with seemingly inadequate support led to the early failure of this otherwise good headsetthese phones sound good for the price but they are uncomfortable
i cant wear them for more than  minutes at a time as they pinch my ears
i expected more comfort from a koss product since koss has provided me with a handful of good headphones over the years
im going to try and return them if i still can and spend a little more to get some more comfortable phonesmy elderly mom purchased this radio perhaps  or so years ago from ccrane
it worked well initially however about a year or two ago it started to fail on herthe lcd display only  works and the switches along the top need to be pressed so firmly her arthritic hands cant do it anymoreit now sits in the closet gathering dust
she has some cheapo drug store radio by her bedside so she can listen to her am radio shows at nightother far cheaper radios and electronic devices have faired much better than this  has
it was great while it was new but not so great anymoreps  the tv band does not exist anymore so that feature is useless too on her radiothe radio has a pretty good tuner and its nice being able to tune in  mhz increments eg
 mhz for our local pbs radio station
my c crane radio has spent almost its whole life on the refrigerator with probably only  trips to live by the washing machine where i fold my laundry and work on bicycle partsdespite the fact that i seldom move this radio the lcd display went bad after  months and now i cannot see anything while tuning
moreover one of the springs in the battery compartment broke off and now its quite difficult to remove and change batteries
and this is after recharging the batteries maybe  times total in the life of the radiotuner quality gets a   tunes like the  radio that it isbuild quality gets a   built like a  radio seriouslyoverall quality is  which i rounded down to two starsi had no idea that the issues we are having with our cc radio were so epidemic
lcd display is intermittant and the preset buttons are flaky
and after reading all these reviews ive no intention of sending it for a rebuilt radiojust to have the same issues return at a later date
how many years have these problems been known about this flawed design
its simply planned obsolescence
they wont see another dime from uswell first the reception
am at times is no better than the little clock radiophone combo sitting  inches from this unit on my night stand
didnt expect better fm reception nor did i get it
at least the speaker was bigger and sounded better than the clock radio
it cost me money to have the led display fixed when it failed after a few years
seems this happened to a lot of units
the fixed version is holding up so far
i happened to call yesterday to see if there was anything i could do about boosting fm reception
finally a talk radio station in my area but its fm
a really nice person tried to help but after exhausting all avenues it was suggested i clip another lead on my pull up antenna and run it outside
for a radio this expensive hanging a piece of wire on the antenna would look like a redneck job
she then said she would find out if a mod they used to do  sounds like i wasnt the only one that wished it had an fm jack in the back  was still available
at least this would make the radio usable
im waiting for her call
this radio should be better than it is for the pricei bought the for an old  computer
it said the hard drive is new
apparently mine was manufactured in april   i bought it sometime in june   so you might not get a new hard drive
i used crystal disk info t check the health status
its in good condition but it ha about  hours on it
its also kind of loud but it works so im happy with itupdate the hard drive gave me the click of death
i expected this to last longer than a year despite its age
i am now disappointed in this product and would never recommend it to anyone unless they like dead hard drivesto anyone i led astray wmy original review  i apologize
when i wrote it i loved the tungsten t  there are better quality pdas out now that are comparable in price to tungsten tit still has good qualities a good screen good maneuverability and good processing speedwhat it doesnt have is good support
around month  i started having issues with a shift in the keyboard
type k and you get a j
first it was only wthe right side of the keyboardthen the left
then it switched  type j and youd get a k
completely screwed upthe odd thing is  i ended up getting used to typing that wayredigitizing helped for short periods of time
maybe  a day
but always it would go back to being fed up
the palm site had a patch that worked for about  minutes
reading online this was not just my problem  but fairly widespreadpalm was of no help
i had no rd party software loaded onto my tungsten  so that wasnt the issue
to have palm quotfixquot it  id have to send it in which was a difficult option
try to fix it yourself and you violate the warrantyi ended up buying a new pda which ill review after a sufficient amount of time in using and giving my tungsten way to someone whom was going to attempt troubleshootingbackground information first im a health care provider so i use the tungsten for inputting and modifying appointments several times per hour  hours a week
for me the ease of inputting and accessing the address book date book and todos is the make it or break it factor
i upgraded from the palm iiic because even though it always served me without any problems it was getting slow in searching for patients names after  years of appointments built up in my datebookgood news second the display is pretty and easily readable the form factor is nice and small so i can just keep it in my pants pocket it plays mps very nicely with a free download of the realplayer the voice recorder activates at the press of a hardware button and comes in handy while driving this pda can sort through  years of my appointments in no time flatbad news third under serious usage the digitizer becomes erratic and terribly frustrating
where you place the stylus can be off by as much as several characters first one way then another then back again with no predictability
unfortunately you usually spot the error after writing in the wrong area or worse pasting instead of copying
it requires almost continual recalibration
its clearly a hardware problem since tapping it on the side causes it to happen but its random and unpredictable
the result is a much slower inputting of data and ample swearingperhaps worse is that the support i have gotten from palm has been very very frustrating
they have replaced the tungsten with another return a couple different times and the exact same bug was present in each machine
while the tech people adamantly deny a hardware problem one of their engineers was upfront with me
he acknowledged the hardware problem but unfortunately couldnt do anything beyond sending me another or advising me to briskly smack it open and shut several timesconclusion if you dont demand too much of the digitizer youll probably be happy
if you get in any trouble and need tech support you may be very unhappy with the company
personally since i like the palm os so much i am about to purchase a sony cliewhen i heard about the tungsten t i was very excited and new i had to buy it
but after i had some time with the unit i found out how little it truely offered especially compared to other handhelds in the highend price rangethe tungsten does have a very good screen and the colors are beautiful
that alone is the only reason i could see why people bought the unit because a great color screen is the only thing this has going for it
it has multimedia capabilities but none are included in the box and after all the excitement of having a realplayer on the palm guess what
palm reps have said dont expect too much to paraphrase them which leaves the audio capabilities in questionthis unit is much better than their previous highend m but like i said it just does not have enough to compete with the sony clie line or the recent new ppc devices that are much cheaper
i wont offer much in the way of the graffiti slider because that is personal preference but let me tell you it gets very old having to slide it all the time to write down quick notesif you are quesioning buying a new highend pda look elsewhere
you can do a lot more with multimedia on a pocket pc or clie and if you just want a good organizer id recommend an os device because any clie will do or even the m if you can live with lowres will be more useful then this
bluetooth is nice but other pdas have it or offer expansion cards so it isnt a big advantage that some make it out to beevery other cd on my spindle has had an error when writing to disc
maybe i just got a defective pack but my trashcan is now full of unusable cdsif you need  cds buy the  pack so youll actually get themwhy why why do i keep turning to memorex
i dont have too many choices and for the most part these are ok cds
yet out of every stack i have bought at least  of these cds will not burn multiple computers do not recognize them as blank discs
this has happened time and time again and unfortunately this paired with the ease in which a cd will become scratched and unplayable forces me to stop buying memorexi have received  complete stereos systems and both arrived with nonfunctioning cd changers
the first cd changer at least played disc  but the second cd changer plays no discs and will not release the  cds that i put in it
i will have to go to a service center just to get the cds out before i return the unit
furthermore this unit is fairly expensive and the fm antenna shipped with it is a simple wire without a connector
they expect you to buy an adaptor or another antenna
however the sound is greatbig problems with the cd player just makes noises all the time doesnt work at all wont open
nice small system cd kills iti purchased this printer in dec  it was my first kodak printer purchase and i was very pleased with it
it did everything i needed it to do print scan copy and fax
good print quality and very fast drying ink
also nice low priced ink refills
i didnt use the printer a lot on average maybe a couple pages printed per dayone day last week i went to print something and i got an error message on the screen indicating the print carriage was jammed
i went through the steps provided on the screen and still jammed
i turned the printer off and back on still jammed
did some extensive research on the internet and found this to be a very common problem with this printer
i then contacted kodaks customer service and while they are very friendly they told me sorry the printer is dead and your warranty is expired
i was very dissapointed to hear this
they then went on to suggest that i should go ahead and buy a new kodak printer because no one else has such low prices on ink refills
i couldnt believe they were telling me this
so it doesnt matter that the printer dies after two years of minimal use because the ink cartridges are so affordablethat was my first and last kodak printeri bought this printer because the product description emphasized the low cost per page for printing supposedly better than with other printers
and because i associate the name kodak with pictures from my film days i thought it might be better for printing photos
that was not the case
i kept this printer for almost a year but i finally became fed up and got rid of it
it worked fine the scanning was fine and the software for editing pictures etc
was fine
i did not bother to print many photos because i found i was constantly replacing ink cartridges
i was buying ink far more frequently than with my hp printer that this one replaced i believe i probably spent twice as much on ink for the kodakordered this printer in january
i was very happy with it for a few days
in february after very little use it begin to jam every time i copied or printedcalled support and after trying for hours to solve the problem kodak agreed to send me a new printer
true to their word the new printer arrived in only  workingdays and i returned the old ones in the container provided
the new printer worked very well for several days
then  after hardly using it for a month or so the same thing all over again jam after jami am currently trying to decide if i want to go through the various attempts to make it work or the task of sending for another and packing this one off
i may just attempt toget my money back and order an hp
although the support team at kodak is very cooperative and does their best to satisfy this printer seems to have a built in flaw thatcauses it to jamstraightwired usb to psb doesnt always work or works intermittenly
be sure this is what youre after before you purchase ittried it with various ps keyboards and usb jacks on the computer sidewith limited successthough its only a few dollars consider that basic usb devices like logitech keyboards for example are usually around  in  dollars us  unless you got a special use might not be worth the hasslethis cable could only come in handy when it comes to using it for a very short ammount of time
this cable started having issues when it came to detecting my keyboard
sometimes it would just not work and it slowly but surly started detaching from the usb end
but in the end you get what you pay forfor the price i suppose i cant be too disappointed but the usb cord seems to intermittently lose its connection to my pc
every so often i have to unplug the adapter then put it back in
lately i seem to need to do this more often
besides this i havent had any issues with the adapter but ive only had the adapter for a month or two and at this rate soon it will no longer be worth using with the frustration it causesedit about two months after writing this review i threw out the cord because it had to be replugged in too frequently to use
all in all the cords lasted about a third of a year and the issue started immediately after buying them and only got worsei tried to use this on my laptop with a ps keyboard
it worked for about  char and would just stop working
i tried to unplug it and replug it again about  or so char
i gave up and bought a usb keyboard that works greatupdate  i no longer recommend the ipaq  pda
while i still like its stylish finish and small size the slow processor mhz slow bus mhz and lack of sdio or any other expansion than sd memory make it a soso value and a crippled device for the wireless future
youll also likely run into endless problems with activesync as i have lately which already gave me tons of new white hair
i also have serious problems with hps customer support and recommend you think twice before subjecting yourself to possible dealing with a customerhostile company like hpthe updated version of the xx series scheduled for a july release will use a nonstandard processor still gives you crippled ram and is not going to be wifi compliant
so avoid those as wellin its place consider a viewsonic vx series if you want something light and thin  and v supports sdio  or a dell axim ugly but packed with features
if you can afford it the toshiba e is the perfect pda with loads of memory dual expansion slots and builtin wifi that works
original reviewive had my ipaq h for two months now
before that i used an audiovox maestro made by toshiba and also a palm m
i had the palm only because i got it for free and used it for one specific palmonly app
i like the pocket pc environment much better so im not an unbiased bystander in the ppcvspalm platform warok thats out of the way lets talk about the  there were two reasons for my purchase
no
 the absolutely beautiful screen
compared to the washedout screen on my maestro the brilliance and richness of color on the  screen is just unbelievable
even after  months i still admire its quality every day esp
since i keep a lot of jpegs and small videos on my ipaq
i keep the backlight level at the midpoint which is totally adequate under  of indoor lighting conditions and also for cloudy outdoor lighting
outdoors when under the sun you can go to bright or superbright and the screen is totally readable
the backlight is also flooded evenly unlike on the dell and viewsonic products
in short the  has one hell of a great screenreason no
 was the compactness
you dont appreciate the smallness and light weight of the  until you see it in real
go to your local compusa best buy or circuit city for a close look
the metallic body is beautiful and you wont believe how compact it is esp
if you are a longtime pocket pc follower
if i had to compare it to a palm model its the palm zire which of course has a dark monochrome screen and only mb of memory not all of which is even usable and absolutely no multimedia featuresso i was sold on the two main selling points of the  visavis other ppc models which are plenty these days
of course with the  you face limitations when it comes to expandability the sd slot is not sdio capable theres no sleeve available theres no cf slotif you are a ppc user you may want to consider the  for its compactness and brilliant screen esp
if you dont plan to use any io peripherals
the s speed is quite good comparable to other mhz ppcs and even to some mhz models
if you are a palm user keep in mind that what you pay for is more than an expensive datebook that happens to run avantgo and vindigo
you also get a multimedia jukebox with video audio and picture support
besides on the ppc you are not forced to learn a new way of writing
but in the end you should play with both to see which interface you like betterthe unit will sometimes leave the display on
this happens without warning
when it does happen the battery drains down to nothing and all your data is lost
hp denies theres a design flaw but just search google for  ipaq  battery problem  and youll see im not the only one with this problem
otherwise its a great unit
im going to try and get a refund for mine and buy something else which doesnt have this problemive been a long time palm user starting with a pro and owning  or  since most recently an m
the screen was what first attracted me to this unit plus the wireless network well it sort of worked for a month but ive had enough
this unit seems like it would be a good idea but isnt
installation and initial sync went very smooth but that was only the beginningday  first day carrying it it locked up solidly  it wouldnt turn off or soft reset i didnt have the cd wthe manual on it bad idea with me so i didnt know how to hard reset
i tried taking the battery off but the unit just came back on in its locked up state when the battery was reinstalled  so i just let it die
i spent that evening getting it running again and trying to get the wireless networking to connect to my linksys wap
after fiddling way too much i finally got my mail and msn messenger to work but not the browser
finally i called hps support site and was warned that any help he gave me was on a best try only basis  no promises  we couldnt get the thing to workday  i left the wireless networking enabled and went to work  the battery was completely dead by noon  with wireless enabled the battery seems to have a painfully short life
so i spent that evening restoring it again
i went to hps website and found an external battery perfect huh
 ordered this puppy immediately  only to find it only works with the expansion pack which adds expansion slots  but also a lot of bulk  just to have a reasonable battery life
i called hp to return it and the agent sent me to the parts department for a second battery to carry
  he assured me that i didnt have the skills to replace the battery
i told him that it just had a little latch on it and it flipped out and i was quite sure i could handle it
he replied that the case was sealed and that no one but hp was authorized to open it
i told him that tech support had asked me to remove the battery to retrieve the serial number from the label under it and didnt see the problem with removing it
he was then very annoyed told me that i didnt know what i was talking about and hung up
i figured that there will be higher capacity batteries in the aftermarket soonnow its over  weeks later and although i havent missed any meetings or anything because this thing failed me ive come close and instead of just grabbing my palm and using it without giving it any thought i find myself reaching for it and wondering if its going to work
i finally decided ive had enough
i picked out one of the new brand name palm os units wmp and ordered it
i then decided to call hp and see if they would consider a return for a one month old order  they did so without hesitation  they looked at their records and saw that i had several tech support contacts on it appologized that it didnt work out and even sent fedex with a pickup tagthe palm is by far a better platform for simple organizer tasks but the ppc horsepower is great when using spreadsheets and the like  i thought i could have boththis is not worth the price
it is not dependable
the picture quality is average at best
the media compartments are flimsy and sluggish in response
look at other brands
for a few dollars more you can do much better think toshiba or sonyyou can put two batteries simultaneously in the mh
but the batteries are not charged simultaneously
first one is charged then the other is chargedthe mh is priced at  plus  for shippingthe mh is priced at  with free prime shippingyou should buy two mh have the ability to charge simultaneously and save my mh is several years old and it has operated flawlessly however the price to value ratio is wrong
i have several mh and they are just as reliablethis product is overrated
i compared this coax cable with a regular no brand type of coax cable on my hdtv and i do not notice any difference in picture and sound quality
the construction of the cable is great thoughlastly the head of the coax cable does not have the thx symbol
so this cable could be fakei will just assume i wasted  because returning is such a hasslei live about  miles away from nyc and use ota broadcast
i have a big antenna in my attic for the last  years
anyway i was planning to move my tv to the other side of the room and needed a long cable
so i connect this cable from the splitter to a db amplifier
before i had  digital channels
after i put this cable in i now have  digital channels
from the antenna plus this  feet cable there is  feet of cable
with my original cable from the splitter to the amplifier it was  feet long a total of  feet of cable
i dont know if its the cable or maybe i need something stronger to boost the tv signals
so i guess i cant rearrange my room for now until i figure what to dothey dont work at all in my lenovo w laptop with windows xp and media player   i have wasted  or more until i worked out that   they work just fine in my wifes dell  with windows  and media player i cant explain why some reviews speculate it is the cd drivei purchased this kvm switch about  months ago or so and it has always given me a flaky performance
switching between my laptop and desktop has been very intermittent in performance sometimes it switches sometimes it doesnt
also sometimes the scroll lock key doesnt respond when you hit it twice to make it switch between machines
to make it work i have to unplug the switch from all my devices then plug them all back in
it is a very big pain in the rear
also when i boot up only one machine it doesnt like that
it seems to like it better if you boot up both machines ack
i hope this thing is under warranty if not i will go with a different manufacturer
i am very disappointed with this linksys productbought this to be able to switch between my computer and my xbox  using one monitor but the problem is there is no manual switch and the  does not have a keyboard so therefore we can not switch between the two
right now trying to find a work aroundthese are so popular i really thought they would be bettermy first issue is that they did not fit my ears properly the pads are too thin and they squeezed my ears which caused them to become very uncomfortable after about mins
i tried adjusting them every which way but it seems i needed to modify the padsmy second issue is that the right speaker completely stopped working after about  months of very light use
i never put them too loud and never dropped them
they sat on my head or my desk always
really sucks to have them die out so quicklysound quality wise these are ok they definitely were detailed and quick accurate but they definitely lacked the sound quality i expected
they also were very anemic in the bass department it was almost nonexistenti now use the sennheiser hd in the link and enjoy them much much more

very comfortable better sounding and cheaperi tried three different headphonessennheiser  prosound was very good especially after some burnin
but very uncomfortable
way to tight  really clamp down hard on your head
this produces great isolation and theyre well built but this is useless if you cant wear them
note i dont have a big headaudio technica athmthe sound on these was just okay and they sit on the ear not around the ear so they dont isolate well at all
they are more comfortable than the s and much lighter but they also feel a little weird being on the ear and i dont know why anyone would buy closed headphones that dont isolateshure srhi think these sound the best
maybe not quite as clear as the senns but they are more dynamic
they feel less like the sound is in a tin can
the sound feels closer
they are very well made
probably the best made of the bunch
and they are comfortable
not as tight as the senns and isolate almost as well certainly well enoughthey look  feel great but i cannot sofar get whatmust be a high impedance to be compatible  workon the toosmall devices ive tried them on
they maybe more compatible with heavier duty studiotype soundequipment
ill try some goarounds when i find the timethese may have needed thousands of watts  studio panel to appreciate or theyre just not that good i couldnt tell so returned em
i couldnt get them comfortable or to sound loud  full they seemed quiet  subdued no matter what i played
whereas a  pair of wicked phones were light cushy deep bass  full tone with an extension cable goldplated connections etc i dont see the need for these at alli tried these with vmoda crossfades
the sound from these was clearly not as good as the crossfades
however i did love the long cord and the padded top headpiece
however the ear pieces ended up putting pressure around my jawline and after about  minutes it was really starting to hurti bought these because i had tried several other headphones one costing  and could not find a pair that offered good sound and was comfortable
these were inexpensive and the reviews were decent so i figured what did i have to lose by trying them
the answer to that question is shipping to and from amazoni cannot recommend them even for tuesday afternoon i got my mm lens
i took some wonderful portrait pictures with it
i loved it
i preferred it over my other mm and  mm lenses
but my happiness didnt last for long
by thursday night something went wrong with the lens
it was strangely acting
it was making noise when it was attached to my ti camera
the shutter inside the lens kept on opening and closing
i had to return this lens
but i will order anotheri picked up this lens primarily to shoot at night or in darker areas with my d
when i got it i was blown away by just how great it was for the pricei purchased this on jan th  and used it quite a lot in  monthsfast forward to may th   reaching into my bag to pull the lens out the entire front of the lens came apart from the rest of itthe build feels like total garbage
it feels like a toy lens but without the indestructibleness of a solid toy
i was shopping around and decided on a canon because it was a first party lens and i assumed the build would be better
after looking around the inside i could see the grooves in which it separated from
after a little bit of fiddling i was able to get the lens back into one piece again but now the auto focus is totally unresponsive at all
hopefully canon can do something for me with this as im trying to send it off to them but since its past the  day mark im not holding my breath
be warned it really is great when it works but theres a reason why people call this the iffy fiftyi am totally disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone who is expecting the quality of a solid lensi returned this lens and got the sigma mm
theres a reason the sigma is more expensive it takes better photos
dont waste your precious photographic moments with this canon lens
you can have better bokeh more clarity and less distortion with the sigma
also if you have other mm filter sized lenses the you can share your polarizer nd and uv filters with the sigma mm f instead of buying a whole new set for this little canon lens
a good polarizer uv and a couple nds will end up costing you the price differenceim happy and im disappointed
im happy i didnt buy the big sister to this lens
not at  times the cost of this lens
from f to about f this lens is almost useless
i know i know a lot of people have shots posted here that they like at  but if you could blow them up to  youd see what we used to call grain and is now referred to as noise
this lens eats light for breakfast and little into lunch
i use a canon ti by no means a slouch of camera
at first i thought there might be something wrong with the lens i received but there doesnt seem to be
i was invited to take some pictures of people in a hospice
until i mounted my xi ii flash the pictures almost all shot indoors were fine to the naked eye but if you take them up to  they granulate
adding the flash httpwwwamazoncomcanonspeedliteiidigitalcamerasdpbccaiserefsrieutfqidsr a great unit by the way took all the worry about shooting inside
ive noticed quite a few people bragging about their shots but the depth of field is so shallow you have to be right on top of it to get your subject in focus
again i thought this might be just meso i went to a couple of respected lens reviews and lo and behold they had the same comments
the f and the  both suffer at low light levels
now one of the reasons i suspect that many people buy a lens like this is to shoot in low light without a flash
which is good and i understand the desirenecessity of doing this but you should realize that without a bright source of light youre usable focus area at f on this lens and on the  will be about the size of a quarter on a x print
the sites report the same findings i found in my every day unscientific shooting
you need light lots of it to really shoot pictures with this lens
if you need to enlarge them at all you should be at least at f
once i was outside and able to get the lens closed down to f the lens rocks
i used the flash as a fill and it really balanced out the picture
i will use the lens in special circumstances but not as my walking around lenstakes great picture when you have a steady hand and when the subject is not moving
if you have kids who constantly move this will be hard to use especially indoorsi love taking picture using natural light so i used it indoors use with kids as subject is not good with this lens
anyway picture is good when the subject is stillbought this lens  years ago
it took some pretty amazing photos during that time
a lot of food photography
quality is great  no amazing  for the pricetoday in the middle of a photo shoot i was lowering the tripod and as i did the lens bumped the side of the table not hit not crash just a slight bump and the lens literally broke in half
the front lens rolled off the table and onto the floor and the other half of the lens remained attached to the camera
a google search revealed several other consumers with the same issuei could not find a way to put it back togethercanon wont fix it after a year
they wanted  to fix it
no thanksi had to run out to a store that claims their buys are the best and had to shell out another  for a new one
not happy
lenses are supposed to out last the camera
my dad is an avid photographer and has had lenses that lasted through the s and s and theyre still perfectly fine to use todayi was totally stoked to get the canon mm ef ii f and read the reviews about how cool it was how the pictures were awesome and how if you are careful the plastic casing wouldnt be an issue
boy was i wrong
let me start by telling you that i adore the photos i have with this lens
completely love them but the problem is i bought the lens in august and it has been broken more than it works
after one months the near focus didnt work
i could only shoot at infinity with it
i sent it back to canon and it took two months to get it back
it worked fine again but i noticed its very loud when shooting ai servo which i did on a dance concert photo shoot where i had  shots with it
it also made grinding noises
i shot with it for about another month and while away on holiday i went to take a shot and the focus didnt work again
i flipped to manual to get my shot before finding a table where i could examine the lens closer but the focus ring would not turn
i took what amounted to a terribly blurry shot and went to a table
i took off the lens and tried to turn the ring again
this time the front glass of the  fell of right in my hand
my lens is now in two pieces and i am ready to call canon to demand a replacement not a repair
i will then sell the replacement and use the money towards a mm fi bought this lens as a gift for birthday
item was delivered couple days before the scheduled arrival time and the packaging was just fine
but the lens happened to have a very noticeable back focus so camera didnt focus properly especially on apertures    and most of pictures come out blurry
too bad going to return it and buy mm this item performed as well as expectedit really makes any photograph look professional
i ordered it upon recommendation of a pro photographer and it delivered as well as he said it wouldhowever when i opened the box the item did not look like it was in its original packagingnot sure if it had just been opened before or used
i wasnt able to send it back though because i needed the lens the day after to shoot my friends graduation picturessoon after my camera began to malfunction and the autofocus couldnt get a clean readit just kept moving trying to focus
same thing with my other lens
one place suggested that i clean the contacts of the camera and each lensit was really dirty
my old lens wasnt dirty at all but my new lens was which in turn made the cameras a little dirtyeverything works fine now and im happy with the lens overalli just dont like the idea that i paid full price for something that was probably used hence the  stars instead of edit i am beginning to have the same problem againit keeps trying to focusyou can actually see the lens focus turning left and right and left againagain this doesnt happen during live view
im knocking it down another star from  to after reading all the great reviews and along with its price i said hey why not
well i shouldnt have
the lens housing is flimsy think cracker jack box
i knew this going in but even i was suprised to see how flimsy it was in person
everyone seems to rave about its sharpness and color quality
it seems to compare to my lens kit which is an mm ultrasonic f in terms of sharpnesscolor
i also shot it against my canon mm f compactmacro w aperture  shutter speed set the same on a tripod for exact results
the results were pretty well dead on
i couldnt see a huge difference in the twoafter shooting with this lens for a couple of hours i decided to put it back in its box and send it back
i dont see what all the hype is about
to top it off its a prime nonzoomlens
i thought i could look past this to get those great shots everyones talking about
after having to move back and forth shooting my products i was almost to tired to package the box for the returni wouldnt recommend getting this lens
save up and buy a better quality piece of glass
hope this helps some of you sitting on the fencei tried  of this lens and all of them had a bit of back focusing issue
if i changed the setting by soldering the board inside it would back focus at close range and front focus at long range
i have a canon ti and i dont have a focusing issue with the kit lens
i can try to have canon fix the focusing issue by sending all of my lenses and camera but after searching google i found that some people tried to fix the focusing issue by sending the units as many as  times but canon just sent them back doing nothing but cleaningrather than be without my camera and paying for the shipping  insurance i just deal with with the focusing issue by using live view shooting but its too slowunless you have a camera that has micro focusing adjustment be prepared for back focusing issue when shooting af
just google canon mm back focusyou get what ya pay for
this is the muchtalked about nifty fifty
out of the box it feels cheap and plastic why because it is a cheap build and plastic af in low light not good it hunts sharp not at all build well as stated plastic build plastic lens had it for less than a year and it is crap go to ebay and buy a asahi pentex mm and an adapter ring and learn to focus manually for half the price
really i own  and they way out work this cheap canon lens geared towards the hobbyist looking for a correct all i am a pro lensgood lens are expensive and when people find a nice piece of glass for cheap the buzz goes around
many time that buzz is spread by people who have never owned or used the lens
it becomes automatic assumption that because it is a mm prime it should be great
dont believe the hypethe first buzz about this lens is its advantage to the nikon equivalent because this lens will af with all the canon rebels dslr
just be ware that the af on this lens is horribly inaccurate so you will end up having to manual focus anyways and that is a pain because of the design of the af ringthe second buzz about this lens is that it is great for low light photography because its f max aperture
just be aware that this lens is useless at f it is soft and flat in color and i mean it
this lens becomes useful only after f so the whole low light advantage is only a mythto be honest i have gotten better and sharper results from the camera kit lens and for that i would caution you to spend your money wisely on a different lensslow to focus if your subject is fast like my  month old daughter your better off trying to take a mental picture because this lens will not deliver
i got rid of this guy and put down the extra  bucks for the usm f
so much faster more accurate to focus and doesnt constantly hunt like the f
the build quality of the f is not good at all it always felt like something was loose in side the lens
i took it to a local camera shop and i was told thats how the lens sounds
its meant to be a cheap  for starters so canon didnt focus on quality and it shows
for the price tag you really cant complain but at the same time i wouldnt compare it to f because the only thing they have in common is the mm focal lengthphotos are great even in low light
i had mine about a year before the auto focus stopped working
even when it did work it was really sloooow
this lens is plastic and cheapim now springing for the  metal versionsave your money for the plastic build and really hit or miss on qualitymy friend loves this thing but i hated it
after selling it to him i picked up the  version i know x the price and it made a huge differenceim in the you get what you pay for camp on this oneif feels really flimsy the front of it can pop out easilyand while pics werent horrible they simply were not the quality of the i have always had a zoom lens and i found it extremely difficult to use a fixed lens
having to move your body back and forth to get the right focal length is harder than it seems
i missed so many great shots
i also used it at night for a jack o lantern blaze event and i felt it still was too dark considering the speed of the lens  i expected a little more
i quickly switched back to my zoom and no longer use this lensi bought this lens for portraits etc  it brings a lot of light and takes nice shots
it does have some trouble focusing and is kind of loud focusing
my main issue is the build
this lens got stuck on my canon ti
i had to really force it off and broke off the plastic back on the lens
over the next few hours of picture taking my camera starting giving me the er error more and more
it turns out the lens broke a contact point on my camera body and shoved it back into my camera
fortunately a local camera shop was able to fix it for very very cheap and only  hour of time
for the price it is still a decent deal
just be careful taking it on and off
i got luckythis lens is overrated
i just took two shots of newspaper print with my xsi camera in lowlight
one with this mm f lens at  and f and the other with my mm is kit lens at  f
the resulting image with the mm kit lens was much sharper
so my simple test proved to me anyways that the is makes the kit lens a better lowlight performer unless you need the higher shutter speed to stop the action
the only other reason to get this lens is the shallower depthoffield afforded by the wider aperture
i would really find this useful but the other thing ive noticed about this lens is that it often misses the focus
so i cant trust italso feels far too fragile to throw the lens in my camera bagjust be very careful not to drop it
i did and now the photos are always out of focus
will probably buy againi am impressed by the brightness of the lens
large aperture
i have to make many more attempts
very lightweight and fits well with my canon tibut came with a manufacturing defect a small point inside the lens it is impossible to clean insideso far i have not noticed this defect in the first test shots but it is terrible that an original canon lens has manufacturing defect
unfortunately  i live outside the united states and i brought it to me by mail i can not return it and wait to submit another by distance and the cost of bringing a package to ecuadordo not get this lens if you plan to use it for video
very low and jerky motor when focusing
i actually found it a little too loud even when shooting stills
i decided to return it and spend the extra money for the f mm instead
ive been much more happy with ithttpwwwamazoncomgpproductbxvczrefohdetailsosiieutfpscthis lens is worth about what you pay for it
its very soft around the edges when wide open
optics are soso but the build quality is very cheap
i think someone else likened it to a cracker jack toy
that pretty much sums it up
this lens if put to good use in the field would literally fall apart
it felt so cheap in my handsrattlecreaking loose cheap
i got rid of it just as quick as i bought iti received my lens quickly in the mail and of course immediately started playing with it as soon as i got it
first off the motor is incredibly loud
secondly it wouldnt focus in auto mode and continued to distort the colors
i dont know if this is just me or this is true for everyone
it was usable on manual focus and i had to keep playing with the exposure settings and white balance for it to expose correctly and be true to color
keep in mind this was with the same environment
the pictures i got after all these adjustments were nice but id sooner save the  bucks and put it towards upgrading to the usm motor
unfortunately mine is going back immediatelyafter selling the old one a few years back along with all my old gear i knew i had to buy it again
this piece of plastic just came in and from testing it i can tell its definitely not as good as the older model
it was redesigned with much cheaper materials but the product link is the same as the original mm  be warned all those beautiful photos you see that customers postedanything from probably  and olderare from the old lenschangesallplastic constructionused to be heavier most likely metalslowernoisier autofocusresulting images are not as crisp despite same settingsif you are broke and want a decent lens to toy around with this will always be a great value and i will a
